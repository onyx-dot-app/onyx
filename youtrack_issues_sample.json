    "description": "In the feedback ticket, it was mentioned  (point 11) that we should integrate Google Postmaster Tools, but there were no details about that, and I feel this is a big task; therefore, I created this separate ticket for it.\nPlease add information about this feature. Thanks\n\n**Update 17-04-2025**\n@vasile before I work on integrating Postmaster Tool into the DmarcReport application, I have some questions.\n\n1. Should a user be able to create multiple postmaster accounts?\n\nNo, we will have only one account for the ADMIN and multiple connected \n\n2. As a user has many accounts/teams, should postmaster account(s) be associated with user teams or the user itself?\nOnly Admin can see that, no sharing in teams. \n\n3. If postmaster accounts are associated with user teams, then should there be permissions created/granted for team invitee to handle/integrate postmaster account(s)?\nNot relevant for now. ( NO) \n\n4. Will there be any association between users' domains in DmarcReport and domains coming from Postmaster?\n\nNo, it will be completely independent. Thank you \n\n5. Where will be Postmaster data shown? It will be a separate page somewhat like in InboxIssue, or there will be a separate link for each domain\u2019s Postmaster data in a specific domain page?\n\nyes a separate menu tab with 2 sub menues, 1 Blacklisted IP 2 Delivery Center\n",

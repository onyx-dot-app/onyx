The company’s [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) is not just about cars or batteries; it is about building a **sustainable energy and AI-driven ecosystem** that compounds [value](https://fourweekmba.com/value-proposition-canvas/) across decades.\n\nThe _Multi-Horizon Strategy Map_ reveals how [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) sequences its ambitions: **optimize production today, expand technological moats tomorrow, and redefine industries in the long run.**\n\nTable of Contents\n\n[Toggle](https://fourweekmba.com/fourweekmba.com)\n\n## Immediate Horizon (0–2 Years): EV Production Efficiency and Scaling\n\nTesla’s survival and credibility depend on execution in the immediate horizon. The company must continue to prove that it can scale EV production efficiently while reducing costs.\n\nKey initiatives include:\n\n- **Manufacturing Optimization** Tesla is expanding Gigafactories, refining production line automation, and relentlessly driving down unit costs. The company’s manufacturing philosophy—vertical integration, simplified [design](https://fourweekmba.com/design-thinking/), and software-defined production—provides resilience against supply chain shocks.\n- **Vehicle Portfolio Expansion** New models such as the Cybertruck and the upcoming “Model 2” (a more affordable EV) aim to broaden [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s market reach. Expanding the vehicle lineup is essential to maintaining demand across diverse segments, from luxury buyers to mass-market adopters.\n- **Battery Production Scaling** Tesla is scaling its 4680 cell production, aiming for vertical integration across the supply chain. Batteries remain the bottleneck of the EV industry, and [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s ability to control this constraint directly impacts cost competitiveness and profitability.\n\n**Immediate horizon success is existential.** If [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) falters here, the long-term [vision](https://fourweekmba.com/how-to-write-a-mission-statement/#Mission_statement_vs_vision_statement) collapses. Yet the company cannot stop at production; the next horizon is where real strategic differentiation emerges.\n\n## Mid-Term Horizon (3–5 Years): Energy, Autonomy, and AI Ecosystem\n\nThe mid-term horizon is where [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) transforms from an EV manufacturer into a broader **energy and AI [platform](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/) company**. This is the bridge between today’s [cash](https://fourweekmba.com/cash-flow-statement/) flow and tomorrow’s dominance.\n\nKey initiatives include:\n\n- **Energy Storage Solutions** Tesla is scaling Powerwall and Powerpack systems, with Megapack deployments already serving grid-scale energy needs. By coupling solar and storage, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) positions itself as a backbone provider for renewable energy infrastructure.\n- **Full Self-Driving Technology (FSD)** Tesla’s most controversial and ambitious mid-term bet, FSD, is built on a [vision](https://fourweekmba.com/how-to-write-a-mission-statement/#Mission_statement_vs_vision_statement) of autonomy powered by data scale and neural networks. With FSD v12+, the company is refining end-to-end AI models while scaling the Dojo supercomputer. Success here would unlock the world’s largest autonomous vehicle fleet.\n- **AI & Software Ecosystem** Tesla increasingly views vehicles as **software-first machines**. Over-the-air updates, firmware integration, and AI training infrastructure make [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) cars not static products, but evolving platforms. Each vehicle is both a [revenue](https://fourweekmba.com/revenue-models/)-generating asset and a data node feeding the AI ecosystem.\n\nThe mid-term horizon is [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s strategic pivot. It transforms the company from a carmaker into a vertically integrated AI + energy [enterprise](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-entrepreneurship/). But the real leap comes in the long horizon.\n\n## Long-Term Horizon (6–10+ Years): General-Purpose Robotics and Humanoids\n\nTesla’s most ambitious horizon lies in robotics. Elon Musk has repeatedly emphasized that the **Tesla Bot (Optimus)** could eventually surpass the car [business](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-a-business-model/) in economic [value](https://fourweekmba.com/value-proposition-canvas/).\n\nKey initiatives include:\n\n- **Tesla Bot (Optimus)** Designed as a general-purpose humanoid robot, Optimus targets manufacturing and service applications first. By leveraging [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s AI expertise, manufacturing processes, and battery technology, Optimus represents an attempt to industrialize robotics at scale.\n- **Autonomous Urban Mobility** Tesla’s robotaxi [vision](https://fourweekmba.com/how-to-write-a-mission-statement/#Mission_statement_vs_vision_statement) aims to transform transportation into a **service platform**. Instead of selling cars, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) could operate fleets of autonomous vehicles, capturing recurring [revenue](https://fourweekmba.com/revenue-models/) from transportation-as-a-service.\n- **AI & Robotics Ecosystem** Over time, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) aims to build an integrated AI learning [platform](https://fourweekmba.com/platform-business-models/) and robot operating system. This could extend [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s reach beyond transportation and into labor markets, logistics, and household robotics.\n\nThe long-term horizon is where [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) positions itself not just as a carmaker or energy company, but as an **AI + robotics infrastructure provider**. If successful, this shift could redefine the company’s valuation, pushing it far beyond automotive multiples.\n\n## Tesla’s Integrated Ecosystem\n\nWhat makes [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s multi-horizon [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) unique is integration. Each horizon reinforces the others:\n\n- **EV production (Horizon 1)** generates [cash](https://fourweekmba.com/cash-flow-statement/) flow and operational scale.\n- **Energy + AI bets (Horizon 2)** create durable moats and new revenue pools.\n- **Robotics + autonomy (Horizon 3)** open entirely new markets.\n\nThe [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) compounds because [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) aligns all horizons under a single [mission](https://fourweekmba.com/how-to-write-a-mission-statement/): **accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy and AI-driven systems.**\n\nUnlike traditional automakers, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) does not treat vehicles, energy, and robotics as separate [business](https://fourweekmba.com/what-is-a-business-model/) units. They are different expressions of the same integrated ecosystem, sharing technology, data, and infrastructure.\n\n## Risks and Execution Challenges\n\nTesla’s multi-horizon [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/) is bold, but not guaranteed. Each horizon faces structural challenges:\n\n- **Immediate horizon risks**: Production delays, quality issues, and competitive EV price wars.\n- **Mid-term horizon risks**: Autonomy remains unproven, with regulatory pushback and technical limitations still unresolved.\n- **Long-term horizon risks**: Robotics may prove technically infeasible or commercially premature for mass adoption.\n\nThe critical question is whether [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) can generate enough short-term [cash](https://fourweekmba.com/cash-flow-statement/) flow to sustain long-term bets without overextending.\n\n## Strategic Lessons\n\n1. **Horizon sequencing matters**: [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) funds radical bets (robotics) with near-term execution (EV scaling). The order is critical: without execution, [vision](https://fourweekmba.com/how-to-write-a-mission-statement/#Mission_statement_vs_vision_statement) is worthless.\n2. **Vertical integration compounds advantage**: By controlling batteries, AI chips, software, and manufacturing, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) reduces bottlenecks across horizons.\n3. **Narrative drives capital**: [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s long-term [vision](https://fourweekmba.com/how-to-write-a-mission-statement/#Mission_statement_vs_vision_statement) attracts investors, enabling funding for ambitious bets even before commercial proof emerges.\n4. **The ecosystem mindset wins**: [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/)’s [strength](https://fourweekmba.com/swot-analysis/) is not in one [product](https://fourweekmba.com/product-management/) but in **connecting horizons into a system** where progress in one reinforces the others.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesla’s _Multi-Horizon Strategy Map_ reveals a company playing a different game. While traditional automakers focus narrowly on vehicles, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) integrates energy, autonomy, and robotics into a single strategic arc.\n\n- In the **short term**, [Tesla](https://fourweekmba.com/tesla-business-model/) must master production scaling.\n- In the **mid term**, it must prove energy and AI capabilities.\n- In the **long term**, it aims to redefine labor and transportation itself.\n\nThis is not incremental [strategy](https://fourweekmba.com/business-strategy/)—it is systemic ambition.

At the heart of this transformation is the revolutionary Ultium battery technology. In this blog post, we’ll explore the future of Chevrolet EVs, the significance of Ultium technology, and why now is the perfect time to consider an electric vehicle from Central Chevrolet.\n\n### The Power of Ultium Battery Technology\n\n#### Modular Flexibility and Efficiency\n\nThe Ultium battery platform, developed in partnership with LG Chem, is a game-changer in the EV market. Its design features modular battery packs that can be configured horizontally or vertically, offering flexibility for a wide range of vehicle types. This innovation allows Chevrolet to efficiently produce different models, from compact cars to full-size trucks, on the same battery platform\u200b ( [Chevrolet](https://www.chevrolet.com/new-roads/electric/next-gen-ultium-platform))\u200b\u200b.\n\n#### Enhanced Performance and Charging\n\nUltium batteries utilize a unique NCMA (Nickel, Cobalt, Manganese, and Aluminum) chemistry, which significantly reduces the reliance on cobalt, a costly and limited resource. This not only lowers the production cost but also improves the battery’s overall efficiency and lifespan. The advanced design supports an 800-volt architecture, enabling faster charging times—up to 100 miles of range in just 10 minutes using DC fast charging stations\u200b. As well, in the near future Tesla will be expanding their support to their supercharger network to General Motors vehicles. Greatly increasing the availability of charging stations available. ( [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/NACS))\n\n#### Superior Range and Power\n\nOne of the standout features of Ultium technology is its impressive range and power capabilities. For instance, the upcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV is expected to offer a GM-estimated 400 miles of range on a full charge. The ability to deliver such extensive range makes Ultium-equipped vehicles a practical choice for both daily commutes and long-distance travel\u200b ( [Chevrolet](https://www.chevrolet.com/new-roads/electric/next-gen-ultium-platform))\u200b.\n\n### Chevrolet’s Expanding EV Lineup\n\n#### Equinox EV and Blazer EV\n\nChevrolet’s commitment to an electric future is evident in its expanding EV lineup, including the Equinox EV and Blazer EV. These models are designed to cater to a variety of customer needs, from family-friendly SUVs to sporty crossovers.\n\n- [**Equinox EV:**](https://www.centralchevyauto.com/searchall.aspx?Make=Chevrolet&Model=Equinox%20EV) Set to debut in 2024, the Equinox EV aims to make electric driving accessible and convenient. It combines a stylish design with advanced technology, offering a practical option for families and urban drivers.\n- [**Blazer EV**:](https://www.centralchevyauto.com/searchall.aspx?Make=Chevrolet&Model=Blazer%20EV) The Blazer EV brings a sporty edge to Chevrolet’s electric offerings. It’s designed for performance enthusiasts who want the benefits of electric power without compromising on style or handling\u200b.\n\n### Why Buy a Chevrolet EV?\n\n#### Environmental Benefits\n\nSwitching to an electric vehicle significantly reduces your carbon footprint. EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, which helps improve air quality and combat climate change. By choosing a Chevrolet EV, you contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\n#### Cost Savings\n\nAlthough the initial purchase price of an EV can be higher than that of a traditional gasoline vehicle, the long-term savings are substantial. EV owners benefit from lower fuel costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and potential tax incentives and rebates. The durability and efficiency of Ultium batteries further enhance these savings by extending the lifespan of your vehicle and reducing the need for costly repairs\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile the initial cost of an EV is higher, there are many rebates and discounts available, including federal and state incentives. Additionally, there are other areas of savings. Some electric providers may offer a rebate when purchasing a Level 2 charger and credits toward your electric bill. Consult your electric provider directly to see what programs they may have available.\n\n#### Cutting-Edge Technology\n\nChevrolet’s EVs are packed with the latest technology, from advanced driver-assistance systems to state-of-the-art infotainment features. The Ultium platform supports over-the-air updates, ensuring your vehicle remains up-to-date with the latest software improvements and features.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe future of Chevrolet EVs is bright, driven by the groundbreaking Ultium battery technology and an expanding lineup of innovative vehicles. Whether you’re looking for a family SUV, a sporty crossover, or a powerful truck, Chevrolet has an EV to meet your needs. Visit Central Chevrolet today to explore our electric vehicle options and take a step towards a sustainable future.\n\nFor more information on Ultium technology and Chevrolet’s electric vehicle

Nolan](https://evmagazine.com/author/stella-nolan)\n\nAugust 03, 2024\n\n5 mins\n\nShare\n\n![](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1800/a64415ee5e474b82d1c3df48c16dac41:d33cf63bcad2aebf2eb3f2bf9da71756/gm-ev-lineup.webp)\n\nGM EV Lineup\n\nGeneral Motors invests US$35bn in EVs and AVs, aiming for an all-electric lineup by 2035 and carbon neutrality by 2040\n\nGeneral Motors (GM), a leading force in the automotive industry, has committed fully to an all-electric future. The ambitious journey reflects GM’s aim to transform its vehicle lineup and achieve significant milestones in sustainability and technology.\n\n## Commitment to electrification\n\nGM\'s vision for an "All-Electric Future" is anchored in a substantial investment strategy. By 2025, the automotive giant plans to invest US$35bn globally in EVs and AVs. The funding will drive advancements in battery technology and expand manufacturing capabilities.\n\nBy 2035, GM aims to phase out all fuel and diesel-powered vehicles, transitioning to an entirely electric lineup as part of its broader goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\n![Youtube Placeholder](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MvP82IsGqNc/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nDespite facing challenges, including a temporary slowdown in EV production due to low demand earlier this year, GM’s EV sales surged in the second half of 2024. The company delivered 21,930 EVs in the second quarter of 2024, marking a promising 40% increase.\n\nThe boost is largely attributed to the success of GM’s new Ultium battery-based EVs, showcasing its [innovation and resilience](https://evmagazine.com/articles/international-energy-agency-gives-insight-into-the-ev-market) in the electric vehicle market.\n\n## The EV1: a bumpy start\n\nThe EV1\n\nGM’s journey towards electrification began with the EV1, introduced in 1996. The pioneering EV was initially received with enthusiasm, prompting GM to consider mass production. However, technological limitations and high production costs led to the discontinuation of the EV1. The controversial destruction of the EV1 units sparked significant debate, notably influencing Chris Paine’s 2006 documentary, _Who Killed the Electric Car?_\n\n## Chevrolet Volt: a new direction\n\nThe GM Chevrolet Volt\n\nThe 2000s marked a period of renewed focus on EVs for GM. Inspired by the success of the Toyota Prius and the emergence of [Tesla Motors](https://evmagazine.com/articles/south-pasadena-police-go-fully-electric), GM re-entered the EV market around 2010 with the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrid vehicle combined a fuel engine with an electric battery, representing a transitional step in GM’s electrification strategy. The Volt was a commercial success, winning multiple awards and becoming the world’s top-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle by the end of 2018.\n\n## The Ultium platform: a pivotal moment\n\nGM\'s Ultium Battery Pack\n\nA significant milestone in GM’s electrification journey was the [introduction of the Ultium battery platform in 2020](https://evmagazine.com/articles/the-ultium-battery-platform-gms-stride-in-ev-innovation). The innovative platform features modular battery and drive unit combinations, offering versatility for a wide range of EVs, including trucks, SUVs and crossovers.\n\nThe Ultium platform, now advanced as Ultium+, addresses range anxiety and [charging infrastructure](https://evmagazine.com/articles/siemens-introduces-depot360-caas-solution-in-the-uk) concerns with its exceptional power, performance and range capabilities.\n\nGM’s strategic partnerships have further bolstered its EV efforts. Collaborations with Honda to co-develop future EV platforms and with LG Chem for battery technology are pivotal in advancing GM’s EV infrastructure.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\n## Expanding the EV portfolio\n\nIn the 2020s, GM expanded its EV portfolio into new markets. The revival of the Hummer brand as an electric vehicle, with the launch of the GMC Hummer EV in 2021, showcased GM’s entry into the electric truck market. The all-electric pickup truck boasts impressive performance metrics, including 11,500 lb-ft of torque and 1,000 horsepower.\n\nIn 2022, GM introduced the Cadillac Lyriq, a luxury EV designed to compete with high-end offerings from Audi and Tesla. The Lyriq combines sleek design with a range of more than 300 miles, reflecting GM’s commitment to innovation and market expansion.\n\n## Future plans and investments\n\nLooking ahead, GM aims to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. The company is ramping up investments in EV and battery technology, including expanding charging networks through partnerships with companies like EVgo. These efforts are intended to enhance the appeal and convenience of owning an EV.\n\nMary Barra, GM Chair & CEO, GM (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nMary Barra, GM Chair and CEO, emphasises the company\'s strategy: “Our multi-brand, multi-segment, multi-price point EV strategy gives us incredible leverage to grow revenue and market share. We believe our Ultium Platform and vertical integration will allow us to continuously improve battery performance and costs.”\n\nGM’s ambitious plans and strategic innovations position it as a leader in the transition to an all-electric future. As the company continues to navigate uncertainties and advance its electrification efforts, its path to sustainability and technological leadership remains clear.\n\n_\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*_\n\n_Make sure you check out the latest edition of_ [_EV Magazine_](https://evmagazine.com/magazines) _and also sign up to our global conference series -_ [_Sustainability LIVE 2024_](https://sustainability-live.com/)\n\n_\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*_\n\n[_EV Magazine_](https://evmagazine.com/) _is a_ [_BizClik_](https://www.bizclikmedia.com/) _brand_\n\n[GM](https://evmagazine.com/search?q=GM) [EV](https://evmagazine.com/search?q=EV)\n\nShare\n\n[Latest\\\n\\\n**Digital Magazine**\\\n\\\nRead Now\\\n\\\n![Read the latest Digital Magazine today!](https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/150/e05e613aeb3bd11fbdb6cce9a47b11a1:a00f62b1069e337f80da9b32ad0318a0/cover-ev-nov2024.jpg)](https://evmagazine.com/magazine/ev-magazine-november-2024)\n\nRelatedContent\n\n- [Volvo: AI-Powered Virtual World Transforms Safety Testing\\\n\\\nTechnology](https://evmagazine.com/news/inside-volvos-innovative-ai-powered-safety-programme)\n- [Germany Weighs in on US Automotive Tariffs Amid Trade War\\\n\\\nMobility](https://evmagazine.com/news/germany-slams-us-auto-tariffs-amid-trade-war)\n- [Trump\'s \'Liberation Day\' Leaves Global Trade At a Crossroads\\\n\\\nMobility](https://evmagazine.com/news/trumps-liberation-day-leaves-global-trade-at-a-crossroads)\n- [Smart EV Charging: Kaluza and PG&E Boost Affordability\\\n\\\nCharging & Infrastructure](https://evmagazine.com/news/smart-ev-charging-kaluza-and-pge)\n\n## Featured Articles\n\n### [Venson: UK EV Drivers Seek VAT Cut on Public Charging](https://evmagazine.com/news/venson-uk-ev-drivers-seek-vat-cut-on-public-charging)\n\nVenson Automotive Solutions reveals UK EV drivers are seeking a VAT cut on public charging to offset rising costs, such as the new VED charges…\n\n### [Woolpert & Chance Maritime: Autonomous Surveying Of Seafloor](https://evmagazine.com/news/woolpert-chance-maritime-autonomous-surveying-of-seafloor)\n\nWoolpert and Chance Maritime leverage autonomous vessel technology to enhance seafloor mapping, improving efficiency, data accuracy and coastal resilience…\n\n### [Volvo: AI-Powered Virtual World Transforms Safety Testing](https://evmagazine.com/news/inside-volvos-innovative-ai-powered-safety-programme)\n\nVolvo harnesses advanced AI techniques to create lifelike 3D environments to enhance vehicle safety systems, aiming to cut the development timeline…\n\n### [Germany Weighs in on US Automotive Tariffs Amid Trade War](https://evmagazine.com/news/germany-slams-us-auto-tariffs-amid-trade-war)\n\nMobility\n\n### [Trump\'s \'Liberation Day\' Leaves Global Trade At a Crossroads](https://evmagazine.com/news/trumps-liberation-day-leaves-global-trade-at-a-crossroads)\n\nMobility\n\n### [Smart EV Charging: Kaluza and PG&E Boost Affordability](https://evmagazine.com/news/smart-ev-charging-kaluza-and-pge)\n\nCharging & Infrastructure\n\n- [UK Rolls Back on EV Incentive Policies in Spring Statement](https://evmagazine.com/news/uk-spring-statement-ev-impact)\n- [Geotab Sustainability Report: Reducing Costs and Emissions](https://evmagazine.com/news/geotab-sustainability-report-reducing-costs-emissions)\n- [Solera Research: EVs Surpass ICE Vehicles in Annual Mileage](https://evmagazine.com/news/solera-reveal-evs-surpass-ice-vehicles-in-annual-mileage)\n- [InstaVolt Milestone: The UKs largest EV Charging Site](https://evmagazine.com/charging-and-infrastructure/instavolt-milestone-the-uks-largest-ev-charging-site)\n- [Imminent Trump Tariffs: Do Automakers Comply or Defy?](https://evmagazine.com/news/imminent-trump-tariffs-do-automakers-comply-or-defy)\n\n---\n\n-------\n\nFinally, here is the previous chat history (if any), which may contain relevant information to answer the question:\n-------\n(No chat history yet available)\n-------\n\n\nGUIDANCE:\n - note that the sub-answers to the sub-questions are designed to be high-level, mostly focussing on providing the citations and providing some answer facts. But the main content should be in the cited documents for each sub-question.\n - Pay close attention to whether the sub-answers mention whether the topic of interest was explicitly mentioned! If you cannot reliably use that information to construct your answer, you MUST qualify your answer with something like \'xyz was not explicitly mentioned, however the similar concept abc was, and I learned...\'\n- if the documents/sub-answers do not explicitly mention the topic of interest with specificity(!) (example: \'yellow curry\' vs \'curry\'), you MUST sate at the outset that the provided context is based on the less specific concept. (Example: \'I was not able to find information about yellow curry specifically, but here is what I found about curry..\'\n- make sure that the text from a document that you use is NOT TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT!\n- do not make anything up! Only use the information provided in the documents, or, if no documents are provided for a sub-answer, in the actual sub-answer.\n- Provide a thoughtful answer that is concise and to the point, but that is detailed.\n- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: Please cite your sources inline in format [[2]][[4]], etc! The numbers of the documents are provided above. Also, if you refer to sub-answers, the provided reference numbers in the sub-answers are the same as the ones provided for the documents!\n\nANSWER:\n\n\nHere are more specifications from the user:\n\nAnswer my query based on the documents provided.\nThe documents may not all be relevant, ignore any documents that are not directly relevant\nto the most recent user query.\n\nI have not read or seen any of the documents and do not want to read them. Do not refer to them by Document number.\n\nIf there are no relevant documents, refer to the chat history and your internal knowledge.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]

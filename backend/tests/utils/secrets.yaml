# Test secrets configuration
# This file defines all secrets used across the codebase, organized by environment.
# It can be consumed by both Python (pytest) and TypeScript (Playwright) tests.
#
# AWS Secrets Manager structure:
#   Each secret is stored as: {prefix}{name} -> plaintext value
#   Example: test/OPENAI_API_KEY -> "sk-..."
#
# Environments allow the same logical secret to have different values/permissions:
#   - test: Read-only credentials for CI/CD and local testing
#   - deploy: Read-write credentials for deployment pipelines

If a mismatch is detected, persist an \u201calignment_failed\u201d status on the record and surface a non-blocking warning in the integration logs for follow-up. This ticket covers backend detection + status recording only; UI gating and \u201capproved messaging only\u201d draft enforcement will be handled in subsequent tickets.",

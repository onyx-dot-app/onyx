      "text": "This change improves how we prioritize issues in the Issue_Tracker by incorporating account context from Customer_Analyzer: `fit_tier` and `segment_id`. Rather than treating all impacted customers equally, we\u2019ll adjust priority scores using a deterministic, config-driven weighting so that issues affecting higher-fit tiers or strategically important segments surface more reliably.\n\nThe primary product impact is more accurate and intentional prioritization across triage, planning, and execution. By applying multipliers derived from existing Customer_Analyzer classifications (no new ICP/segment logic), we can align engineering focus with customer value without changing how customers are defined\u2014only how their impact influences scoring.\n\nOperationally, the pipeline will degrade gracefully: if an issue has mixed accounts, missing metadata, or partial coverage, the system will fall back to current scoring behavior instead of failing or producing unstable rankings. This reduces risk of regressions and prevents \u201cunknown\u201d metadata from unintentionally skewing the backlog.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll persist the fit/segment-weighted components in the issue/theme score breakdown to improve auditability and debugging. This makes it clear why an issue moved up or down, supports downstream analytics, and enables iterative tuning of the config mappings without requiring changes to core prioritization logic.",

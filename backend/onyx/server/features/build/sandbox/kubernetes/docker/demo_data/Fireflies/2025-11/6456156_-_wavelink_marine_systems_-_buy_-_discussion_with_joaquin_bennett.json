    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: Yeah, that works. We\u2019re definitely interested. I just want to make sure we\u2019re buying something we can actually operationalize and not just another \u201cinsights\u201d tool.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Let me anchor on what you told me last time: you want your team aligned on who your best-fit marine operators and partners are, and you want sales enablement that actually helps reps handle objections consistently. The two parts of Customer_Analyzer that map most directly are the fit score and the positioning recommendations\u2014especially the objection-handling playbook that\u2019s tied to real drivers and evidence. Is that still the core?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: Yes. The enablement angle is big. We\u2019ve got reps saying different things, and marketing is producing content that doesn\u2019t always match what prospects care about.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. Then here\u2019s how I\u2019d frame it in practical terms. First, we ingest the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding notes, any product usage events you can share, support ticket themes, even interview notes if you\u2019ve got them. From that we generate fit drivers\u2014what correlates with successful customers\u2014and produce a fit score at the segment level and account level. Second, and this is the part your sales team will feel immediately, the positioning recommendation feature turns those drivers into editable messaging blocks: value proposition, differentiators, proof points to collect, pricing/value framing, and a clean objection-handling guide. All linked back to the evidence so reps trust it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: The linking back to evidence is interesting. My concern is adoption\u2014reps don\u2019t like \u201ctheory.\u201d They want something they can use in a call tomorrow.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t just output a PDF. The messaging shows up as blocks you can drop into your deck bullets, your email openers, and your call talk-tracks. For example, if a segment\u2019s top fit driver is \u201creliability under harsh conditions,\u201d the value prop and differentiators will reflect that, and the objection playbook will include: \u201cIf they say \u2018your system is too complex,\u2019 respond with X, supported by Y proof point,\u201d and it will tell you what proof points you\u2019re missing so you can collect them intentionally.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-7"
    },
    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: That would help. Right now objections like \u201cintegration will be painful\u201d or \u201cwe already have a vendor\u201d are handled differently by every rep.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great example. Customer_Analyzer will surface which objections show up most in your notes and tickets, and then recommend responses grounded in what best-fit customers actually valued. So instead of generic \u201cwe integrate with everything,\u201d you get segment-specific language: \u201cHere\u2019s how operators like you reduced install time,\u201d plus a list of proof points to gather\u2014like a one-pager from your implementation lead or a short case snippet. It\u2019s a system for making enablement consistent and measurable.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: Okay. The other thing we talked about is our data being messy. Our CRM has missing fields. We don\u2019t always tag segments consistently. I don\u2019t want the fit scoring to be garbage-in, garbage-out.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5139301-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: You\u2019re right to flag it. Data quality and missing fields can reduce scoring accuracy if we treat everything as required. Two things we do to de-risk that: (1) we start with the signals you do trust and that are reasonably complete\u2014often a handful of CRM fields plus a couple sources like onboarding survey responses or support ticket categories. (2) we show \u201cconfidence\u201d and \u201ccoverage\u201d indicators so you can see when a score is based on thin data. We\u2019ll also give you a short recommended field and tagging cleanup list\u2014usually 5\u201310 items\u2014that improves accuracy quickly without boiling the ocean.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. Typical month one for a team like Wavelink Marine Systems is: week one, connect CRM and import whatever customer notes and ticket themes you have. Week two, generate initial segments and fit drivers; you\u2019ll validate with your team\u2014quick workshop. Week three, positioning recommendations for your top two target segments, including the objection-handling playbook. Week four, roll it into sales enablement: update your deck, create a one-page \u201cobjections and responses\u201d sheet, and we measure usage with a simple workflow\u2014like requiring the rep to choose the segment in CRM so the right blocks show up in the right places.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly\u2014because the goal is impact fast. Let me ask: if we delivered, say, a segment-specific objection guide that your team actually uses, and it shortens cycles or improves win rate, is that enough to justify the purchase this quarter?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. To make this easy, I suggest we lock in a 12-month subscription for Customer_Analyzer with the positioning recommendations included, and we define success criteria around sales enablement: two segments live, objection-handling playbook adopted by the team, and a set of proof points collected. I can send a proposal today with pricing and a simple implementation plan you can forward. Then we schedule a quick 20-minute approval call with ops/finance. Does that fit?",

That includes onboarding, the segment workshop, and the positioning blocks and playbooks. If you want expansion later\u2014more segments or additional data sources\u2014we can add it, but you don\u2019t have to start there.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally. Here\u2019s how we bake adoption in: we don\u2019t measure success by \u201clogins.\u201d We measure it by outputs in the workflow\u2014updated deck bullets, email openers, and the objection guide that reps reference. And because the recommendations are editable messaging blocks, marketing can own the final copy while sales owns the call usage. We\u2019ll also set a recurring check-in for the first 60 days to tighten the segments and make sure the playbook matches what\u2019s happening in real calls.",

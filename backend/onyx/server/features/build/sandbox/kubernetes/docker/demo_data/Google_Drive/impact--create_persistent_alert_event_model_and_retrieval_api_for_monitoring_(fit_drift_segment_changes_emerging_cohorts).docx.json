      "text": "This feature introduces a persistent, normalized \u201calert event\u201d data model to store monitoring outcomes such as fit drift, segment changes, and emerging cohorts. By standardizing fields like alert type, referenced entity, timestamps, computed metrics, thresholds, evaluation window, and a dedupe key (per GOLD-40), we create a durable source of truth for what was detected, when, and why\u2014beyond ephemeral logs or one-off notifications.\n\nOn top of this storage layer, we will add retrieval APIs that allow downstream systems (UI surfaces and notification pipelines) to list and fetch alert events with practical filters: alert type, segment/customer, and time range, plus pagination for scalable browsing. This enables consistent user experiences such as an \u201cAlerts\u201d feed, drill-down into an event\u2019s supporting metrics, and targeted views per customer or segment without re-deriving results from raw monitoring runs.\n\nTo ensure operational correctness, writes will be idempotent via the dedupe key so repeated evaluations or retries do not create duplicate events. This reduces noise, prevents alert fatigue, and makes event counts and timelines reliable for both product analytics and customer-facing experiences.\n\nFinally, we will set basic retention/archival defaults appropriate for low-priority monitoring to balance auditability with storage cost and performance. This provides enough historical context for trend review and debugging while keeping the system lightweight and maintainable as alert volume grows.",

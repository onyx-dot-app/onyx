      "text": "This feature adds a backend ingestion endpoint and durable storage for closed-loop learning outcome events, using the canonical event schema defined in GOLD-106. By validating and persisting these events centrally, we establish a reliable system of record for recommendation outcomes (e.g., accepted, ignored, completed) that can be queried and replayed over time.\n\nA core impact is accurate attribution: every stored event will carry joinable keys like `recommendation_instance_id`, account/opportunity and CRM identifiers, and segmentation fields (rep, motion, segment). This makes downstream aggregation and analysis trustworthy\u2014enabling us to connect \u201cwhat we recommended\u201d to \u201cwhat happened\u201d across CRM objects, users, and go-to-market segments.\n\nWith this pipeline in place, we unlock closed-loop learning and measurement: model training signals, per-recommendation success rates, cohort comparisons, and ROI reporting become feasible without ad hoc event stitching. Product and data teams can answer questions about recommendation quality and behavior change with consistent, durable inputs instead of relying on brittle client-side logs.\n\nFinally, minimal observability (invalid-event counters, ingest latency, and drop/error logs) improves operational confidence without introducing risk to core recommendation flows. Failures in telemetry ingestion won\u2019t block recommendations, but they will be visible quickly, allowing us to detect schema drift, integration issues, or performance regressions before they undermine attribution and learning quality.",

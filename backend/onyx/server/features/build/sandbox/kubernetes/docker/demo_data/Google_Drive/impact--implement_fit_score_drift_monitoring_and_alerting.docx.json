      "text": "This feature adds automated monitoring to detect drift in our model\u2019s \u201cfit score\u201d outputs, so we can catch when score behavior changes in production before it impacts decisioning, downstream conversion, or user trust. Today, we largely rely on ad hoc checks and delayed signals; drift monitoring provides an always-on safety net that flags issues as soon as they emerge.\n\nWe\u2019ll track key distribution and performance indicators over time, including fit score distribution shifts (e.g., mean/variance, quantile movement, PSI/KS-style signals) and\u2014where labeled outcomes exist\u2014calibration and segment-level lift/quality changes. Monitoring will be segmented (e.g., by traffic source, geography, customer type, or other meaningful cohorts) to ensure we detect localized drift that might be hidden in global aggregates.\n\nWe\u2019ll define explicit drift thresholds and alerting rules, and when thresholds are exceeded the system will trigger notifications to Slack and/or email. Alerts will include actionable context: the affected model version, the segment(s) impacted, and the time window, along with links to relevant dashboards or investigations so engineering/data science can quickly validate and triage.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll persist drift events in a durable store for auditing and analysis, creating a historical record of model health over time. This improves governance and accelerates retraining decisions by making it easy to see drift frequency/severity, correlate events with releases or data changes, and prioritize when and where model updates are needed.",

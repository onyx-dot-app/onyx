Ensure the generator deterministically selects which positioning blocks to reference (e.g., top N approved blocks) and gracefully falls back to the existing initiation flow when data is missing or stale. Add a small set of unit/fixture tests to confirm the Customer_Analyzer fields are reflected in the generated initiation guidance.",

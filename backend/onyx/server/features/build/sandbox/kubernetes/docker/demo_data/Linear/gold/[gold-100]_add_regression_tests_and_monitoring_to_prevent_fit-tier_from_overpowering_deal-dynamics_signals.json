Add lightweight monitoring (dashboards/alerts) that tracks score-component distributions and flags workspaces where fit-tier contribution exceeds configured thresholds under negative deal dynamics. Use scenarios and thresholds derived from the GOLD-97 audit report to prevent future scoring regressions.",

When gaps are detected, surface actionable guidance (e.g., suggest alternate discovered fields from GOLD-67, recommend enabling CRM field history tracking, or allow marking a field as optional with impact warnings). Block completion only for truly critical missing fields and persist validation results for audit/debugging.",

Define a deterministic mapping (config-driven) from fit_tier/segment to multiplier(s) and ensure issues with mixed/missing account metadata degrade gracefully to current scoring. Persist the computed segment/fit-weighted components on the issue/theme score breakdown for auditability and downstream debugging.",

I work with teams that are trying to turn messy customer feedback and support noise into a clean, prioritized list of \u201cwhat we fix next.\u201d Does that sound relevant at Orchardline Supply right now?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s exactly the problem Issue_Tracker is built for. It\u2019s an issue-intelligence and triage layer that sits between your support tools like Zendesk or Intercom and delivery tools like Jira or Linear\u2014plus it pulls in customer and revenue context from your CRM. Instead of another ticketing system, it standardizes an \u201cissue object\u201d: the theme or root cause, the evidence from real conversations, and which customers are impacted\u2014then keeps that linked to the downstream engineering work.",

      "text": "Madeline Cho: Okay. We\u2019ve tried tags and dashboards, but it still turns into debates in triage meetings. What\u2019s actually different?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Two things tend to change the game. First is deduping and clustering\u2014Issue_Tracker continuously ingests customer-reported problems and requests and automatically groups duplicates into themes, so you don\u2019t have ten tickets that look different but are actually the same root cause. Second is issue_prioritization: each cluster gets an explainable priority score based on inputs you control\u2014frequency and velocity, severity, customer tier or ARR, churn-risk flags, and segment importance. The key is it\u2019s not a black box; you can see why something rises to the top.",

    {
      "text": "Madeline Cho: \u201cExplainable\u201d is good, because our product and support teams argue about severity all the time. How do you keep it from being just another score people ignore?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: We\u2019ve found the score matters most when it\u2019s grounded in business impact and tailored views. Issue_Tracker can show different lenses for different teams: Support can see SLA and escalation risk; Product can see impact versus effort; Sales can see deal blockers; Exec can see revenue exposure. Everyone\u2019s looking at the same clustered issues, but through the lens that matches their decision-making. That\u2019s what reduces the circular debate.",

    {
      "text": "Madeline Cho: We\u2019re especially struggling with prioritizing issues for our best-fit customers. Sometimes lower-value segments flood us with volume and it crowds out what matters.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s a perfect fit for one of the core use cases. If you\u2019re already segmenting customers by fit\u2014say ICP Tier-1 versus lower-fit\u2014Issue_Tracker can weight issue clusters using those fit tiers so problems impacting Tier-1 customers outrank similar-volume issues from low-fit segments. So you\u2019re not just prioritizing by \u201chow many people complained,\u201d you\u2019re prioritizing by \u201cwho is complaining\u201d and what that means to retention and growth.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Typically no. We can pull the customer tier signals from your CRM and, if you have something like a customer fit model, connect that context as well. The idea is to use what you already trust\u2014ARR bands, segments, churn-risk flags\u2014and apply it consistently to every issue cluster. If those signals are messy today, that\u2019s actually a good starting point for a working session: we map the fields you have, decide which ones should influence priority, and set sensible defaults.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Totally. Issue_Tracker isn\u2019t trying to replace Jira. It sits between support and Jira. Once an issue theme is validated and prioritized, you can link it to the Jira epic or ticket your team already uses. The value is the issue object remains the source of truth for \u201cwhy we\u2019re doing this,\u201d with evidence attached\u2014support conversations, account notes\u2014while Jira remains the system of record for delivery. That way, when someone asks \u201cwhy is this P1,\u201d you don\u2019t have to dig through six tools and Slack threads.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. Each cluster maintains a defensible history: who reported it, what they said, how often it\u2019s appearing, and which customers are impacted. That makes prioritization conversations faster and more consistent, and it makes status updates easier because you can trace the issue through to the engineering work and back to the original customer conversations.",

      "text": "Mina Park: For a first step, I\u2019d suggest a 30\u201345 minute working session rather than a generic demo. We\u2019d look at three things: one, where your customer-reported issues currently come from\u2014Zendesk, Intercom, email, call notes; two, what customer context you trust most\u2014ARR, segment, ICP tier; and three, how you run triage today\u2014who decides, and what \u201cpriority\u201d means at Orchardline. Then we can show you Issue_Tracker prioritizing a handful of real clusters in the Product view and the Exec revenue-exposure view.",

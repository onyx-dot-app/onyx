      "text": "This feature upgrades `issue_clustering` to v2 by enabling cross-language clustering of customer-reported issues. Today, identical problems raised in different languages often fragment into separate clusters, which dilutes signal and makes it harder to understand true issue volume and impact. By detecting language at ingestion time and routing text through a multilingual normalization + embeddings pipeline, we can group semantically equivalent reports together regardless of the language they were written in.\n\nThe primary product impact is improved accuracy and consolidation in issue analytics: fewer duplicate clusters, clearer top-issues rankings, and better prioritization decisions driven by global customer feedback rather than English-only visibility. This also increases the usefulness of clustering for support and product teams operating in multilingual markets, reducing manual triage and translation work to determine whether a \u201cnew\u201d report is actually a known issue.\n\nFor transparency and trust, the clustering inputs will persist detected language, original text, and the normalized/translated representation (when used). This improves auditability (why did these items cluster?), enables better search and debugging, and supports future UX features like showing the original alongside the normalized form. It also provides a foundation for downstream workflows that may want to filter, segment, or report by language.\n\nTo protect existing performance, we\u2019ll add lightweight evaluation checks to validate that cross-language equivalents co-cluster while maintaining English-only clustering quality. The expected outcome is broader coverage (more conversations meaningfully clustered) with no regression in current English clusters, making issue clustering more reliable as a single source of truth across regions.",

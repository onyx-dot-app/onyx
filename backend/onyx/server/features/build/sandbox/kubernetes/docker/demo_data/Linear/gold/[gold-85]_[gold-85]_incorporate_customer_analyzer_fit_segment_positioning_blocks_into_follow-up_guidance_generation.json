      "text": "Update the follow-up guidance generator to consume the Customer_Analyzer context (fit score, segment, approved positioning blocks) surfaced by the retrieval layer when producing next-step recommendations and messaging for in-flight opportunities. Implement deterministic selection rules for which approved positioning blocks to reference (e.g., top N, stable ordering) and ensure graceful fallback to the existing follow-up flow when data is missing, stale, or unmapped. Add unit/fixture tests that verify the Customer_Analyzer fields are reflected in generated follow-up guidance and that fallbacks behave correctly.",

      "text": "Forecast outputs currently diverge from manager intuition without clear drivers, reducing early trust. Add an explainability panel that breaks the forecast into key contributing signals (e.g., stage, recent activity, fit score, slippage risk) with per-signal impact and last-updated timestamps. Ensure the breakdown is consistent across account/opportunity views and uses the same inputs as the forecasting model so managers can validate why the number moved.",

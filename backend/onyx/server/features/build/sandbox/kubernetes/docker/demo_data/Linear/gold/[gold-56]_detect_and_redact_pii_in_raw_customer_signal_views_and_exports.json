      "text": "Implement a PII classification/redaction layer for ingested customer signals so sensitive fields (e.g., emails, phone numbers, addresses, free-text notes) are masked by default in UI raw-record views and export/download payloads. Allow workspace admins to explicitly permit unredacted access per role with a clear \u201cview sensitive data\u201d permission, and ensure the redaction behavior is consistently applied across API responses used by the UI and export endpoints. Add unit/integration coverage for common PII patterns and verify no regressions in fit-score/positioning pipelines that rely on non-PII features.",

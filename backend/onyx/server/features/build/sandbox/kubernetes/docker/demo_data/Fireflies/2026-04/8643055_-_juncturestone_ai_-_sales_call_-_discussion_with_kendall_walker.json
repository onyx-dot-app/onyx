      "text": "Camila Vega: Hi Kendall, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to get clearer on which customer segments are actually driving expansion and which ones are pulling your roadmap in the wrong direction. I thought today we could focus on how Customer_Analyzer supports product planning, and then see if it\u2019s something you want to move forward with. Sound okay?",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Perfect. Quick recap: Customer_Analyzer ingests signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, support tickets, interview notes\u2014and turns them into two outputs. One is a fit score by segment, and the other is positioning recommendations tied to those fit drivers and actual customer language. For today, I\u2019d love to concentrate on the positioning_recommendation feature and how it helps you make product planning calls with more confidence. Does that align with what you\u2019re evaluating?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Kendall Walker: The product planning angle is the priority for us. The positioning piece is interesting too, but I\u2019m cautious about anything that feels like \u201cAI writes our messaging,\u201d because our exec team can be\u2026 skeptical.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6030369-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally fair. And we\u2019re not trying to replace your strategy. The core value is: we connect \u201cwho is succeeding with your product and why\u201d to \u201chow you talk to those segments,\u201d so your roadmap bets and your go-to-market message reinforce each other. The positioning recommendations come out as editable blocks\u2014like a segment-specific value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, proof points to collect, value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook. And crucially, each recommendation links back to the underlying drivers and the evidence it used.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Kendall Walker: When you say \u201cevidence,\u201d what does that actually look like? Because fit scores and recommendations can be a black box. If my product leads ask, \u201cWhy is this segment high fit?\u201d I need to show more than \u201cthe model said so.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Yep, that\u2019s one of the most common concerns. In the UI, when you click into a segment, you see the top fit drivers\u2014like activation time, feature adoption patterns, ticket volume by category, renewal outcomes, sales cycle length\u2014whatever signals you connect. Next to each driver, we show the supporting slices: the actual CRM fields, usage event trends, and representative snippets from surveys or tickets that correlate with successful outcomes. So if it\u2019s claiming \u201cSegment A values workflow automation,\u201d you can see the wording customers used and which behaviors align with retention or expansion.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Kendall Walker: Okay, but correlation isn\u2019t causation. We\u2019ve been burned by dashboards that look scientific but don\u2019t hold up when we make decisions. And frankly, our data is messy. CRM fields aren\u2019t consistent, support tags are a disaster, and product events are only partially implemented.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6030369-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s also common, especially in scaling teams. The way we handle it is: we start with the signals that are most reliable and highest coverage, and we\u2019re explicit about confidence. If your CRM fields are inconsistent, we lean more on usage patterns and qualitative inputs like onboarding surveys and ticket themes. And we\u2019ll show coverage and confidence right alongside the drivers\u2014so you\u2019re not asked to trust an output without knowing the data quality behind it.",

    {
      "text": "Kendall Walker: How much work is it to get to that point? Because we don\u2019t have engineering time to build a bunch of pipelines. And we\u2019re already mid-quarter; I can\u2019t sign up for a months-long implementation.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Understood. Most teams start with lightweight connectors: your CRM, your support system, and basic product event export. Then you can layer in things like interview notes later. The goal in the first couple of weeks is not perfection\u2014it\u2019s directionally accurate segment prioritization you can pressure test. For product planning, you\u2019d use it to identify high-fit customers with unmet needs\u2014so you can validate which roadmap bets will move retention and expansion.",

      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6030369-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great question. The positioning_recommendation isn\u2019t just copy\u2014it\u2019s a structured summary of what matters to a segment: top use cases, differentiators, and objections. For product planning, those become inputs: if the segment\u2019s key use case is \u201cautomate approvals across teams,\u201d and the top objections are \u201ctoo hard to configure\u201d and \u201cmissing audit trails,\u201d that points directly to roadmap items. Plus, we list \u201cproof points to collect,\u201d which often exposes gaps\u2014like if customers keep asking for compliance assurances, you may need product capabilities or at least validated evidence to support it.",

      "text": "Kendall Walker: I get the idea. But again\u2014how do I know the system isn\u2019t over-weighting whatever happens to be in support tickets this month? Our support volume spikes around releases and doesn\u2019t always reflect strategic value.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6030369-14"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s where the evidence view helps. You can see which sources drove each recommendation and adjust weighting by source. If support is spiky, you can down-weight it or time-bound it. And we encourage teams to treat the first pass as a hypothesis generator\u2014then you validate with a quick qualitative check, like five customer calls in the top segment to confirm the story.",

      "text": "Kendall Walker: That still sounds like extra process. And I\u2019ll be honest, we already have an internal ICP deck and a bunch of persona work from last year. My leadership is going to ask why we need another tool versus updating what we have.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6030369-16"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Completely fair. The difference is this stays live. Your ICP deck is a snapshot; Customer_Analyzer updates as your customer base and product usage evolve. It helps you avoid drifting into lower-fit segments because of one loud customer or one sales-driven push. And it gives you consistent messaging blocks sales and marketing can actually use\u2014tied to the segments that are empirically succeeding.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: You can absolutely override segment definitions and thresholds, and you can create your own segment rules.

    {
      "text": "Kendall Walker: That workshop idea is okay. But there\u2019s a practical hurdle: data privacy and access. Some of our interview notes and support content are sensitive. Our security team is strict about SaaS tools ingesting that kind of data.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Understood. We can scope initial ingestion to non-sensitive sources\u2014CRM plus anonymized usage events\u2014and still get value. Then, if security approves later, you can add richer qualitative sources. We also have controls for redaction and source-level permissions, so not every user sees raw text. But if your security posture means \u201cno tickets, no notes,\u201d we should be realistic about the depth of positioning language we can generate.",

      "text": "Kendall Walker: That\u2019s exactly it. If we can\u2019t include tickets or notes, the \u201cobserved customer language\u201d part feels weak. And without that, I worry the recommendations will read generic\u2014like any other AI output.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: If you only do CRM plus usage, the positioning blocks will still be grounded in behavioral drivers, but yes, you\u2019ll get less direct voice-of-customer phrasing. Some teams solve that with onboarding survey snippets instead\u2014those are often less sensitive than tickets. Do you have an onboarding survey today?",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Got it. Then we\u2019d need to decide whether the initial phase is primarily fit scoring for product planning, with positioning as a secondary output, versus a full messaging revamp. If product planning is the key, we can start by identifying which segments show the strongest retention and expansion signals\u2014and where usage indicates friction that aligns to unmet needs.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: I hear you. What I\u2019d propose is a limited pilot: one or two segments, a small set of signals, and a clear success criterion\u2014like \u201cdoes this change our Q2 roadmap prioritization or our segment focus for outbound.\u201d Then you decide if it\u2019s worth expanding.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: That makes sense. If it helps, I can share a sample output in your domain and we can do a working session where you bring one skeptical stakeholder and we walk through the evidence links together. That usually defuses the \u201cblack box\u201d concern.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6030369-29"

    {
      "text": "Kendall Walker: Maybe. But realistically, I don\u2019t think I can get another stakeholder into a working session this month. We\u2019re in planning and everyone\u2019s slammed. And if we can\u2019t bring in tickets or notes, it\u2019s hard to justify this versus just doing analysis in-house.",

      "text": "Kendall Walker: Possibly, but then it\u2019s a different product than what you\u2019re pitching. The positioning recommendations were what got my attention in the first place, but that\u2019s also where our constraints hit hardest. I\u2019m not ready to move to buying right now.",

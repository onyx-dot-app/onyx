      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Emma\u2014Mina Park here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll keep this quick. I work with teams that are getting swamped by customer issues coming in from Zendesk/Intercom, then getting re-triaged again in Jira, and the same \u201cissue\u201d shows up in twenty different ways. Does that sound familiar at Truenorth Circuits?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: Hi Mina. Yeah, we definitely have a lot of incoming, but we already have a process. We use Zendesk and Jira and our CSMs track key accounts pretty closely.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally\u2014most teams do. The gap we see is not \u201chaving tools,\u201d it\u2019s having a consistent issue object across tools: one theme/root cause with evidence, impacted customers, and a clear status that doesn\u2019t get lost between support, product, and CS. Our product, Issue_Tracker, sits between Zendesk/Intercom and Jira/Linear and continuously ingests the raw tickets/chats/email summaries, then automatically deduplicates and clusters them into issue themes.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: Okay. We actually do a lot of manual tagging and we have some macros and views for that. I\u2019m not sure we need another layer in between.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That makes sense. The two areas where teams usually feel relief quickly are, first, issue clustering\u2014so instead of 40 separate tickets with slightly different wording, you get one cluster with top phrases, representative examples, and links back to every source record. And second, a lightweight workflow to merge/split clusters with guardrails, so it stays accurate without becoming a full-time job.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: The concern is always: clustering sounds nice, but we already have categories and labels. Also, AI grouping can be messy, and my team doesn\u2019t have time to babysit it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Completely fair. The reason customers like the clustering is it\u2019s not just labels; it\u2019s semantic similarity plus configurable rules\u2014like product area, platform, severity, and keywords\u2014so you can keep it constrained to how Truenorth thinks about the product. And the output is something actionable: \u201chere\u2019s the cluster, here are the top examples, here are the impacted accounts,\u201d rather than just another tag field.",

    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: We\u2019d still need to see whether it really saves time. Right now, support triages, then product reviews weekly, and CSMs follow up when there\u2019s something notable. It\u2019s not perfect, but it works.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: If it\u2019s working, I don\u2019t want to disrupt it. The use case I wanted to sanity-check is specifically around consistent follow-up. For CSMs, Issue_Tracker lets you subscribe accounts to relevant clusters. When the linked Jira ticket ships, we record the release milestone and create a history trail of which customers were notified and when\u2014so you\u2019re not searching through old threads or relying on someone\u2019s spreadsheet.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: We do have a spreadsheet for follow-ups, and honestly it\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s also simple. My bigger issue is change management. If I add another system, support has to learn it, CS has to learn it, product has to trust it, and engineering will ignore it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s a common fear. The way we try to avoid \u201canother system\u201d is: Zendesk stays Zendesk, Jira stays Jira. We link back to the source conversations and downstream engineering work. The idea is you don\u2019t have to change where people live day-to-day\u2014Issue_Tracker becomes the shared layer where the issue cluster lives and stays consistent.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-11"

    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: Integration is always the sticking point. We\u2019ve been burned by tools that promise \u201cplug in Zendesk and Jira\u201d and then it\u2019s weeks of configuration and permissions and cleanup.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. I\u2019m not going to claim it\u2019s zero effort. But in many setups, the initial value comes from just connecting the support source and creating clusters\u2014no need to rebuild workflows. We can start small: one product area, one or two queues, see if clustering reduces duplicate triage and makes volume/trends visible.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s helpful to know. Let me ask one quick question to see if there\u2019s a pain worth revisiting later: do you ever have situations where a \u201cwidespread problem\u201d is underestimated because it\u2019s scattered across many tickets and channels, so it doesn\u2019t look big until it\u2019s too late?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-15"
    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: Sure, that happens. But we usually catch it in our weekly reviews or when a couple big customers complain loudly. It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s not our top priority right now.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Got it. And on the follow-up side\u2014do CSMs ever miss notifying a customer when a fix ships, because the Jira ticket status changes but nobody ties it back to the right accounts?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: Occasionally, yes. But again, we manage it. We have internal notes, and our CSMs are on top of their accounts. I\u2019m not convinced we need dedicated software for that.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Fair. My goal today wasn\u2019t to force it\u2014just to see if it\u2019s worth a deeper look. If we did a 30-minute walkthrough, I\u2019d show you two things: how clusters are formed from your existing Zendesk inputs, and how account subscriptions and release milestones create an audit trail for customer comms.",

    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: I appreciate it, Mina, but I\u2019m going to be honest: I don\u2019t think I can commit to another evaluation right now. We\u2019re already reviewing a couple tools and my leadership wants us to focus.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-20"

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: I respect that. Would it be okay if I sent a one-pager that summarizes the clustering and the CSM follow-up history trail, and then I check back in, say, next quarter when things calm down?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4173458-21"
    },
    {
      "text": "Emma Fowler: Yes, a one-pager is fine. But I can\u2019t promise timing. If you send it, I\u2019ll skim it, and if it becomes more urgent we can reach out.",

      "text": "Mina Park: That works. Last thing\u2014so I tailor the summary: are you more interested in the \u201cdedupe/issue trends\u201d angle for support/product, or the \u201cCSM follow-up and notification history\u201d angle for CS?",

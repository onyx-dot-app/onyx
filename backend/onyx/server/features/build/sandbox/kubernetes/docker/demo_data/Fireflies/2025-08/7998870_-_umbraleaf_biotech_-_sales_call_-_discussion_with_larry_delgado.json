Last time you mentioned the support team is drowning in repeat tickets and it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s truly urgent versus just loud. I wanted to focus today on how Issue_Tracker clusters and prioritizes issues so you can get to a decision on whether it\u2019s worth piloting at Umbraleaf.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair. Issue_Tracker isn\u2019t trying to replace Zendesk or Jira. It sits in between and standardizes an \u201cissue object\u201d\u2014a theme with evidence, impacted customers, and linked Jira work\u2014so teams stop debating what\u2019s real and what matters most. The two things I\u2019d like to show conceptually are: clustering to reduce noise and issue prioritization that\u2019s explainable and tied to business impact.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Understood. In most deployments, support reps keep working in Zendesk. Issue_Tracker continuously ingests and deduplicates in the background. The output is for support ops and product: instead of 5,000 tickets a month, you see ~80 active themes with representative examples and a list of affected customers. Then you route the top 10 clusters weekly into your product/engineering review.",

      "text": "Larry Delgado: That \u201ctop 10\u201d sounds nice, but we already tag tickets and have macros. The real fight is prioritization\u2014product thinks everything is \u201cnot planned\u201d and support thinks everything is urgent. How are you actually scoring it?",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Great question. The issue_prioritization feature ranks clusters with a transparent score based on inputs you control: frequency and velocity, severity tags, customer tier or ARR, churn-risk flags, and segment/ICP importance. If you have Customer_Analyzer, we can weight issues that impact your highest-fit biotech segments more heavily. And if you connect CRM or Sales_Accelerator, we can boost issues that are blocking late-stage opportunities or creating forecast risk.",

    {
      "text": "Larry Delgado: We don\u2019t use Customer_Analyzer today, and our CRM data is messy. Also, my concern is that \u201crevenue exposure\u201d and \u201cdeal risk\u201d are going to bias everything toward sales noise. We\u2019re biotech\u2014some issues are compliance or lab workflow critical even if it\u2019s not a huge ARR customer.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/2061375-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That makes sense. You can tune it so severity and regulatory flags carry more weight than ARR. The point is: the score is explainable, not a black box. In the Support view, it can emphasize SLA risk and severity; in Product, impact versus effort; in Exec, revenue exposure. You can start with a simple model: frequency + severity, and add business weighting later if you want.",

    {
      "text": "Larry Delgado: Okay, but we already have dashboards that show top ticket categories. The missing piece is getting engineering to trust it and act. They live in Jira. If Issue_Tracker becomes yet another place they have to check, it\u2019ll die.",

The happy path is: Issue_Tracker clusters and produces a short weekly \u201ctheme packet\u201d\u2014evidence links back to the Zendesk tickets, impacted customers list, trend line\u2014then you push a single Jira epic per theme. Engineers stay in Jira; the epic stays linked to the theme so support can see status without chasing PMs.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s fair. The way teams adopt it is by using it as the single source of truth for \u201cwhat are customers actually experiencing,\u201d not \u201cwhat are we building.\u201d The prioritization helps align support and product on what\u2019s painful and widespread\u2014then product still decides where it lands on the roadmap.",

Could we involve your security or legal team for 20 minutes to understand constraints? If we can clear that, the value is pretty direct: fewer duplicate tickets, and a defensible weekly top-themes list.",

If time is the constraint, we could keep it minimal: two weeks of historical Zendesk data, we generate the clusters, and we review the top 10 themes together\u2014no workflow change for agents.

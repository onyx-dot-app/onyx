    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally. The product is called Customer_Analyzer. It pulls together signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and turns that into a simple fit score by segment and by account. The point is: instead of debating \u201cWhich industries should we target?\u201d you can prioritize using actual retention and support burden signals.",

      "text": "Peyton Davis: We\u2019re a shipping company\u2014so I\u2019m not sure how relevant the \u201cproduct usage events\u201d part is. And we already have reporting in our CRM.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Fair question. We\u2019re not trying to replace reporting. The difference is the fit estimation layer\u2014Customer_Analyzer computes a 0\u2013100 fit score and, more importantly, a driver breakdown: why a segment scores high or low. For example, you can weight drivers like industry, size, problem severity, willingness to pay, time-to-value, and support burden. Then it compares segments\u2014say manufacturing vs retail\u2014based on outcomes like renewal or expansion.",

    {
      "text": "Peyton Davis: We don\u2019t really sell SaaS, though. We\u2019re services-heavy. A \u201cfit score\u201d sounds a little\u2026 generic.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That makes sense. The fit drivers are configurable so it\u2019s not generic\u2014if your team cares about time-to-value and support load more than feature adoption, you set it up that way. A lot of services orgs still have the same issue: some customer types are profitable and smooth to onboard, and others churn, escalate, or require more support than they\u2019re worth. Fit estimation helps quantify that and show it by segment.",

    {
      "text": "Peyton Davis: We already know which customers are painful. The issue is more operational\u2014capacity, lanes, contracts. I\u2019m not sure a new tool helps.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Understood. The use case I had in mind for Goldenharbor was: next-quarter industry targeting. If you\u2019re deciding where to push sales effort, Customer_Analyzer can combine retention history with support burden\u2014ticket volume, escalation tags, SLA misses\u2014so you can see, \u201cThis segment retains well and is low-support,\u201d versus \u201cThis one renews but costs us a ton.\u201d It helps make the prioritization conversation faster and more defensible.",

The first output is the segment comparison and the driver breakdown\u2014so you can validate whether the model is pointing at what you already suspect, and where it\u2019s uncovering something you didn\u2019t.",

In that call, we\u2019d map your data sources and show a sample fit driver setup for your world\u2014like contract type, lane complexity, claims rate, onboarding effort, and renewal likelihood.",

One thought: if you\u2019re doing a TMS upgrade, there\u2019s often a moment where you\u2019re rethinking what \u201cgood customer\u201d looks like\u2014because you\u2019ll have cleaner data. Customer_Analyzer can sit on top and translate that into segment priorities. But I don\u2019t want to force it if timing\u2019s off.",

If we made this extremely low-lift\u2014like a 20-minute working session where you just tell me the top 5 \u201cfit drivers\u201d you already use informally, and we show how the scoring and segment comparisons would look\u2014would that be worth it?

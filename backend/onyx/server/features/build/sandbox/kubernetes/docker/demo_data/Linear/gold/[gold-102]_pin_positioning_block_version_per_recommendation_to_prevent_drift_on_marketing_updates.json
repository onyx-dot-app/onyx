Persist the chosen version id on the generated recommendation/message record so re-renders, edits, and follow-up sequences remain consistent even after Marketing publishes a new version. If a requested version is missing/unavailable, fail with a clear error and fallback to the last known pinned version (no silent auto-upgrade).",

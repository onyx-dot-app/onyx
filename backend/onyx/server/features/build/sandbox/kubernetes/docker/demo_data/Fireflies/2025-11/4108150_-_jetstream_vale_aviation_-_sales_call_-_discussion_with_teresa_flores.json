      "text": "Megan Foster: Hi Teresa\u2014good to see you again. Last time you mentioned Jetstream Vale Aviation was interested in tightening follow-ups after discovery and getting a cleaner view of what\u2019s actually going to close. Does that still feel like the right priority for this quarter?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: Hi Megan, yes. We\u2019ve got decent top-of-funnel, but our follow-through is inconsistent and the forecast is\u2026 not great. Leadership is pushing for fewer surprises at the end of the month.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s exactly where Sales_Accelerator tends to land value fast. Since you already have Customer_Analyzer in the mix, Sales_Accelerator sits on top of Salesforce and uses those fit scores and positioning blocks you\u2019ve already built\u2014so we\u2019re not asking you to redo ICP or messaging. The two areas I\u2019d suggest we focus on today are: (1) explainable sales forecasting, and (2) AE follow-up recommendations right after discovery. Sound good?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: Yes, those two are the big ones. We\u2019re especially trying to standardize what happens after a discovery call.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. On the forecasting side: Sales_Accelerator combines your CRM stage data with activity signals\u2014emails, calls, meetings\u2014plus cycle-time benchmarks. If you choose, it can also use Customer_Analyzer fit score as a weighting factor. The output is the usual commit / best-case / pipeline views, but what\u2019s different is the \u201cwhy.\u201d It shows the drivers: stage age, last touch, whether a next meeting is scheduled, fit tier, and how similar deals historically convert.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: When you say activity signals, are you reading our emails and call notes? That\u2019s one of our concerns\u2014privacy and compliance.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair, and it comes up a lot. You can control the data sources. Many teams start with metadata only\u2014timestamps, meeting scheduled vs not, last activity date\u2014without ingesting email body content. If you want the follow-up drafting piece, that\u2019s where you\u2019d allow the system to reference approved notes or transcripts, but we support consent controls, redaction options, and retention settings so you can align with your policies.",

    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: Okay. We\u2019re in aviation\u2014PII and customer data handling is sensitive. We\u2019d need to be sure we can limit what\u2019s stored and who can see it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Absolutely. We can scope it so only specific fields are stored, and we can keep it within your CRM governance model for access\u2014role-based permissions. In the pilot, we can start with forecasting that uses stage + activity metadata + fit score only. Then, if you\u2019re comfortable, we expand to the post-discovery follow-up workflow with stricter guardrails.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: That\u2019s reassuring. Forecasting accuracy is a pain point, but honestly the bigger immediate issue is deals stalling because reps don\u2019t send a strong recap or they don\u2019t multi-thread.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Let\u2019s dig into that use case. After a discovery call, Sales_Accelerator prompts the AE with a recommended follow-up package: it drafts a recap email, suggests two tailored proof points from the approved positioning library\u2014pulled from what you already have in Customer_Analyzer\u2014and it can generate a mutual action plan with due dates and stakeholders. The goal is to make the \u201cright next step\u201d the default, not something that depends on the rep\u2019s memory.",

    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: How \u201cautomatic\u201d is that? We don\u2019t want reps blasting out something that\u2019s off-brand or includes something sensitive from notes.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: It\u2019s recommended, not auto-send. The AE reviews, edits, and sends. And the proof points are only from your approved positioning blocks\u2014so you\u2019re not getting random AI-generated claims. For the recap, you can choose what inputs it uses: for example, \u201cuse only the AE\u2019s structured call notes fields\u201d instead of pulling verbatim transcript text. That\u2019s often the cleanest path for compliance.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-13"
    },
    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: That could work. Our reps do fill out structured notes, even if they\u2019re inconsistent about it. Another issue: we already have Salesforce dashboards. Sales ops will ask why we need another layer.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-14"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Great question. We\u2019re not trying to replace your dashboards; we\u2019re trying to turn them into action. Salesforce tells you \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhere it sits.\u201d Sales_Accelerator adds two things: explainable forecasting drivers and best-next-action guidance. For example, it\u2019ll flag, \u201cThis deal is in stage 3, but stage age is 2x your benchmark, last touch is 12 days ago, and no next meeting is scheduled\u201d\u2014and it will recommend the next step and prompt the follow-up sequence. That\u2019s hard to operationalize with static dashboards alone.",

    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: That makes sense. My VP will want to see how it improves forecast calls specifically. We have weekly commits and it\u2019s always a debate.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: In forecast calls, managers can see commit/best-case/pipeline by segment, rep, or source, with slippage diagnostics\u2014like which stages are leaking and which reps have outlier cycle times. The key is the scenario planning: \u201cIf we add 20 SQLs in ICP Tier 1, what\u2019s the expected impact?\u201d It ties pipeline generation to outcomes using your historical conversion, plus fit tier weighting.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9456333-17"

    {
      "text": "Teresa Flores: The scenario planning is interesting. We\u2019ve been arguing about whether to focus more on Tier 1 accounts or expand. Having a model would help, as long as it\u2019s explainable.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly\u2014and it is explainable. You can click into a forecast number and see the driver breakdown. It\u2019s not a black box. Also, because it consumes Customer_Analyzer fit tiers, you can see how much of your pipeline is truly ICP-aligned, and how that affects forecast confidence.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: I\u2019d propose a focused pilot with one team\u2014say 6\u20138 AEs. Two success criteria: (1) forecast accuracy improvement measured by variance between commit and actual, and (2) time-to-follow-up and consistency after discovery\u2014like % of deals with a recap sent within 24 hours and a mutual action plan created within 72 hours.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Because it sits on top of Salesforce, setup is mainly: connect Salesforce, map your opportunity stages, connect activity signals (often via your existing calendar/calling tool integrations), and connect Customer_Analyzer so we can pull the fit scores and positioning blocks. Sales ops typically spends a few hours on mapping and permissions, then we configure the forecast views and the follow-up templates.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: For AEs, it\u2019s light: it shows up as \u201cnext best actions\u201d on the account and opportunity, plus a post-discovery checklist. For managers, it\u2019s a forecast workspace that replaces spreadsheet gymnastics. We usually do one enablement session for reps and one for leaders, then weekly check-ins during the pilot.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Two things: first, confirm the pilot group\u2014who the 6\u20138 AEs and one manager would be. Second, introduce us to whoever owns data governance/privacy so we can document the Phase 1 boundaries\u2014no email body, metadata only, retention rules. After that, I\u2019ll send a pilot proposal with timeline, success metrics, and pricing to align to a buying decision.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Absolutely. I\u2019ll send a one-pager today with the Phase 1/Phase 2 scope, the controls around PII, retention, and permissions, and the success criteria we discussed. If we aim for a 30-day pilot starting next month, does that fit your timeline?",

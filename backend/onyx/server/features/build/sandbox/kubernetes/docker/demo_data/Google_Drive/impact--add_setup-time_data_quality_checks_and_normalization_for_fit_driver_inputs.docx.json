      "text": "This feature adds setup-time validation and normalization for connected data sources used in Fit Driver configuration, reducing noisy or inconsistent inputs before they reach fit scoring. During setup, we\u2019ll automatically detect common data issues (missing required fields, inconsistent enum values, empty strings, and obvious outliers) and apply safe normalizations (e.g., trimming whitespace, normalizing casing) so users start from a cleaner baseline.\n\nA new compact \u201cData Quality\u201d panel will surface actionable issues while users configure Fit Drivers, highlighting what\u2019s wrong, where it\u2019s occurring, and how to fix it. Where possible, we\u2019ll provide suggested mappings (e.g., common synonyms or variant spellings for categorical values) and flag fields with low fill rates that may weaken scoring reliability, helping users choose better drivers or fix the source data.\n\nThe expected impact is higher accuracy and stability of fit scoring by reducing garbage-in/garbage-out effects, fewer support tickets and manual debugging around \u201cwhy is my scoring weird,\u201d and faster onboarding because users can resolve issues upfront rather than iterating after results look off. This also increases user trust by making data readiness transparent and giving clear next steps.\n\nFinally, normalization rules will be persisted per workspace so once a team resolves common inconsistencies, subsequent ingests stay consistent without repeated effort. This compounds value over time: setup gets easier for future data sources, scoring becomes more comparable across runs, and teams can scale Fit Drivers across datasets with less operational overhead.",

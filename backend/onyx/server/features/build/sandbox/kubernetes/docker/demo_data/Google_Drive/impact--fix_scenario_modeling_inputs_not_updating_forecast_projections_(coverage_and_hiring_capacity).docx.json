      "text": "This fix ensures scenario modeling remains trustworthy by making forecast projections recompute every time a user updates key inputs like pipeline coverage targets and hiring capacity. Today, those changes can fail to propagate through the model, leaving totals and recommendations based on stale data and creating a high risk of users making planning decisions from incorrect projections.\n\nFrom a user experience standpoint, the impact is immediate: adjusting coverage or capacity will reliably refresh all dependent values in the UI\u2014overall totals, deltas versus baseline, and per-segment breakdowns\u2014so what users see always matches their latest assumptions. This reduces confusion (\u201cwhy didn\u2019t anything change?\u201d) and increases confidence that the scenario output reflects the knobs they\u2019re turning.\n\nFrom a product and business perspective, this improves decision quality for headcount and pipeline planning, and reduces support load and escalation risk stemming from inconsistent model behavior. It also aligns the scenario tool with expectations for interactive modeling: inputs should be deterministic, responsive, and consistent across all views.\n\nTo prevent regressions, we\u2019ll add a lightweight automated test that asserts a recalculation occurs on each relevant input change and that dependent projections update accordingly. This gives ongoing protection as we evolve the scenario model logic and UI, ensuring we don\u2019t reintroduce stale projections in future releases.",

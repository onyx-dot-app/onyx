      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. I\u2019ll keep it tight. I\u2019m calling because a lot of beverage brands end up with the same problem: customer issues are coming in from Zendesk, chats, and even account notes\u2014then the team tries to translate that into Jira, and it turns into a lot of duplicate triage and \u201cis this the same thing?\u201d debates. We built Issue_Tracker to sit between support and engineering and basically standardize the \u201cissue object\u201d so you can see the real themes, impacted customers, and status in one place. Curious\u2014how are you handling that today at Oceanmint?",

    {
      "text": "Eugene Ray: It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Zendesk is the source, but a lot of context lives in Salesforce and in CSM notes. Then product gets a Jira ticket, but it\u2019s hard to tell how widespread something really is. We end up chasing squeaky wheels.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s exactly the gap Issue_Tracker is designed for. The first thing it does is ingest the raw inputs\u2014tickets, chats, emails, even summarized call notes\u2014then it automatically deduplicates and clusters them using semantic similarity plus rules you can set, like product area, platform, severity, or keywords. So instead of 80 separate tickets about \u201cpromo code not applying,\u201d you see one cluster with volume, top phrases, representative examples, and links back to each source record in Zendesk.",

      "text": "Eugene Ray: Okay, so it groups them. We\u2019ve tried tagging, but it\u2019s inconsistent.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally\u2014tags rely on humans being perfect. The clustering is automated, but also controllable: you get naming suggestions for clusters, you can merge or split clusters with guardrails, and each cluster keeps structured fields like affected product area and suspected root cause category\u2014bug vs UX vs missing feature vs integration. The impact is you stop underestimating issues that look small individually but are actually huge across many tickets.",

    {
      "text": "Eugene Ray: That would help. One challenge is product doesn\u2019t trust support labels, and support doesn\u2019t know what engineering is doing.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9907249-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. The second piece is the linkage downstream. Issue_Tracker doesn\u2019t replace Jira\u2014when you connect a cluster to a Jira ticket, it maintains that relationship and keeps status consistent across teams. So CSMs and support can see \u201cthis cluster is tied to JIRA-312, in progress,\u201d and product can see the evidence and customer examples without digging through Zendesk.",

      "text": "Eugene Ray: What about follow-up? We\u2019ve had cases where we fix something and only a few customers get notified.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great point\u2014that\u2019s actually one of the most common use cases. CSMs can subscribe specific accounts\u2014like a strategic account or a whole segment\u2014to a relevant cluster. Then when the linked Jira ticket ships, Issue_Tracker records the release milestone and creates a history trail: which customers were impacted, which ones were notified, when, and with what message. So you can run consistent follow-up instead of relying on someone remembering to circle back.",

Out of curiosity, how many tickets are you handling per week, roughly?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s a perfect volume for clustering to pay off quickly. Usually the first win is visibility: within a week or two, teams realize, \u201cOh, this is actually three big themes, not 200 random tickets,\u201d and they stop duplicating triage. Second win is customer comms: CSMs know exactly who to update when a fix ships.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. For a first pass, it\u2019s typically lightweight: connect Zendesk, connect Jira, map a few rules like product areas or severity terms, and decide who owns merge/split decisions for clusters. You can start with one queue or one product line, prove it out, then expand. The goal is to get value without boiling the ocean.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: It varies, but the sweet spot is a partnership: Support Ops or CX owns the inbound sources and workflows; Product Ops or an engineering triage lead owns the downstream mapping to Jira. The point is that the system keeps everyone aligned without requiring everyone to live in the same tool.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Yes\u2014that\u2019s where the merge/split workflow helps. The model will suggest clusters, but if something is too broad, you split it into sub-issues with guardrails so you don\u2019t create chaos. And because everything stays linked to source records, you can always click back to see the exact customer language and context.",

      "text": "Mina Park: The best next step is a quick 30-minute working session where we look at: your Zendesk structure, how Jira tickets are created today, and one or two recent \u201cfire drill\u201d issues\u2014like an integration outage or promo problem.

The job should compute calibration metrics (e.g., reliability curves / Brier score) and key business KPIs deltas vs the currently deployed model to confirm true performance degradation. Store results with model/version + timeframe metadata so subsequent retraining/recalibration tickets can use a consistent baseline.",

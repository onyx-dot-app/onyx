      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces scoring-configuration plumbing to cap the fit-tier component weight when specific deal-dynamics risk signals are present (procurement stage, competition, internal alignment), without changing overall ranking logic.\n\nChanges:\n- Adds new scoring config fields for per-risk fit-tier caps (e.g., `fitTierCaps.procurement`, `fitTierCaps.competition`, `fitTierCaps.internalAlignment`) plus a default/no-risk baseline.\n- Persists these fields in the existing workspace/environment-scoped scoring config store, with defaults populated from the GOLD-97 audit recommendations.\n- Updates the score-component calculation for fit-tier to:\n  - evaluate whether each risk signal is triggered for the deal,\n  - compute the effective fit-tier weight as `min(baseFitTierWeight, activeCap)` (with a deterministic precedence when multiple risks are active),\n  - apply the capped weight only to the fit-tier component while leaving other components and final aggregation/ranking unchanged.\n- Adds config parsing/serialization + a small test suite covering defaulting, persistence, and cap application for single/multiple risk cases.\n\nNotes:\n- No UI/validation changes are included; configs can be tuned via existing config mechanisms per workspace/environment.\n- Ranking behavior is unchanged except for the fit-tier component weight being reduced when the configured risk conditions are met.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

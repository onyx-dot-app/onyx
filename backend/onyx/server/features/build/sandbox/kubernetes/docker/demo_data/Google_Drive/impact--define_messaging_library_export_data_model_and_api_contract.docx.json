      "text": "This feature defines the canonical export data model and API contract for sharing approved Messaging Library assets (value propositions, differentiators, proof points, objections) with downstream sales and marketing tools. By establishing a stable specification up front, we remove ambiguity for both internal engineering teams and external integrators, enabling parallel development and reducing rework during implementation.\n\nThe impact is a reliable, consistent representation of messaging content across systems. Clearly defined required fields and identifiers ensure exported assets can be consumed without custom interpretation, while supporting common workflows like search, display, and attribution to product/segment/persona context (as applicable). A durable contract also creates a foundation for future expansion (new asset types, metadata, localization) without breaking existing consumers.\n\nVersioning and approval-state rules materially reduce risk in go-to-market operations. Downstream tools should only receive content that is explicitly approved, and version semantics prevent accidental overwrites or \u201csilent changes\u201d that cause sales teams to pitch outdated or unapproved messaging. Mapping rules (how to tell updates vs. new exports) enable incremental sync rather than fragile \u201cfull refresh\u201d behavior.\n\nFinally, documenting endpoints/payloads and the expected authentication method is a key enabler for execution. It allows subsequent implementation tickets to proceed against a stable, reviewable contract; simplifies QA by making expected behaviors explicit; and supports security/compliance review early, before the integration is live in production.",

I\u2019m calling because we built Issue_Tracker to help support and product teams stop drowning in duplicate tickets by turning raw customer noise into a small set of clear, prioritized issue themes.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great question. Issue_Tracker connects to your support channels\u2014think Zendesk, Intercom, email\u2014and continuously ingests tickets, chats, even call-note summaries. Then our issue clustering automatically deduplicates and groups them into semantic clusters, like \u201cbilling portal times out on Safari\u201d or \u201cmeter data export missing columns,\u201d instead of 300 separate tickets scattered across agents and queues.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Tags are a start, but they depend on perfect, consistent agent behavior\u2014and they don\u2019t usually merge duplicates across wording differences. Clustering looks at the actual text and groups similar reports together, then suggests a cluster name, highlights top phrases, and gives you representative examples. You can also merge or split clusters with guardrails, so you\u2019re not locked into a black box.",

    {
      "text": "Sophia Chen: Hmm. We\u2019re in utilities, so our issues can be pretty specific. Also, we get a lot of \u201cmy bill seems wrong\u201d that\u2019s not always the same root cause.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally. That\u2019s why each cluster can carry structured context beyond \u201csame complaint.\u201d You can configure rules by product area, platform, severity, or keywords, and you can label suspected root cause categories\u2014bug vs UX vs missing feature vs integration. For \u201cbill seems wrong,\u201d you might end up with separate clusters like \u201cTOU rate misapplied,\u201d \u201cestimated read confusion,\u201d \u201cPDF bill totals mismatch,\u201d each with links back to the original conversations.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly\u2014and we\u2019re not trying to replace Jira. Issue_Tracker standardizes an \u201cissue object\u201d that stays linked to the source tickets and can be routed downstream. Practically, support ops can take, say, 5,000 monthly tickets and have them clustered into around 80 active themes, then route the top 10 clusters weekly to product/engineering\u2014each with representative examples and the list of affected customers.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Makes sense. Even at smaller volumes, the big benefit is visibility and defensibility. Instead of someone saying \u201cI feel like we\u2019re hearing this a lot,\u201d you can show volume trends, what customers are impacted, and the supporting evidence\u2014without manually hunting for examples. It reduces duplicate triage work and helps prevent widespread issues from being underestimated because they\u2019re scattered across many tickets.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: The initial setup is usually lightweight: connect the support channel, map a few fields, and define any rules you care about\u2014like segment or product line. The system starts clustering automatically, and your team can refine it via merge/split as you go. It\u2019s designed to reduce work, not create a new taxonomy project.",

If it\u2019s a custom or older platform, we\u2019d want to confirm what connectors are feasible\u2014sometimes we can ingest via email or API exports, but I don\u2019t want to overpromise without seeing what you\u2019re using.

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Understood. If APIs are limited, that might constrain real-time clustering. In some cases we can work off periodic exports, but if that\u2019s not possible, Issue_Tracker may not be a fit right now. Before we call it, can I ask\u2014what\u2019s the biggest pain in your current triage process: duplicate reports, routing, or proving impact to engineering?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s fair. Where Issue_Tracker tends to help there is ensuring the limited engineering capacity is aimed at what matters most\u2014because you can see which clusters are most widespread and which customer groups are affected. But if your constraint is purely capacity and not prioritization or visibility, it may not move the needle enough.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Makes sense. The main difference would be automating that aggregation so your leads aren\u2019t spending hours stitching together examples, and making sure duplicates don\u2019t inflate or hide the real signal. But I hear you\u2014if the current workflow is \u201cgood enough,\u201d it\u2019s hard to justify adding a new layer.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Thanks for being direct. Given the budget freeze and the integration constraints, it may not be the right time.

Drafts are generated only from Customer_Analyzer messaging blocks that are `approved` and match the currently active messaging version.\n\n## Key changes\n- Added a shared messaging-block selection/validation step used by both draft endpoints.\n- Filters Customer_Analyzer messaging blocks by:\n  - `status == approved`\n  - `messaging_version == active_messaging_version` (as provided by the existing version lookup)\n- If the target record is `alignment_failed` (existing sync check) **or** the filtered set is empty, draft generation is prevented and a structured `blocked` response is returned.\n\n## API behavior\n- Both initiation and follow-up draft endpoints now return a consistent blocked payload when enforcement fails.\n- Response shape (high level):\n  - `status: \"blocked\"`\n  - `reason: \"alignment_failed\" | \"no_approved_blocks\"`\n  - Optional metadata (e.g., expected version / counts) for UI messaging.\n\n## Notes\n- No changes to the prompting/model behavior when generation is allowed; this PR only gates inputs and standardizes failure handling.\n- Intended for UI to surface a \u201ccannot generate draft\u201d state instead of producing an unapproved/mismatched message.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

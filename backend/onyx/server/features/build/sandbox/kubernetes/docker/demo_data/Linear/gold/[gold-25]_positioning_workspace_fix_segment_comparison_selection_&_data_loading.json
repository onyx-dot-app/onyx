Ensure the comparison UI always reflects the currently selected primary and comparison segments, with a single source of truth for selection state and a deterministic data-fetch lifecycle (cancel/ignore in-flight requests, prevent race conditions). Add basic logging around selection changes and fetch completion to aid verification and future debugging.",

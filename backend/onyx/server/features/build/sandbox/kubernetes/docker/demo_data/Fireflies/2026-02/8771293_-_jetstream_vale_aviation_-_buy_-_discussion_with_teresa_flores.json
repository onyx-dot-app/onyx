On forecasting, we\u2019re not just reading CRM stage\u2014Sales_Accelerator combines stage with activity signals like last touch, meeting scheduled or not, stage age, and your cycle-time benchmarks. Then it produces commit/best-case/pipeline views with explainable drivers, so when a deal slips, the \u201cwhy\u201d is visible.",

In our forecast view, if a deal drops from commit to best-case, it will tell you what changed\u2014like \u201cno next meeting scheduled,\u201d \u201cstage age above benchmark,\u201d or \u201cfit tier lower than typical wins,\u201d if you choose to include the fit score input. That\u2019s what drives adoption with managers: it\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s drivers you can audit.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: After discovery, the AE clicks \u201cGenerate Follow-Up\u201d on the opportunity. The tool drafts a recap email, pulls two proof points from your approved positioning library, and creates a mutual action plan with due dates and stakeholders\u2014so you can multi-thread and keep momentum. The big value is consistency: even newer AEs get a solid baseline, and managers can see whether next steps are actually defined.",

We can also disable certain inputs\u2014like not parsing raw emails or not storing call transcripts\u2014while still getting value from CRM fields and activity metadata like \u201cmeeting happened\u201d or \u201cnext meeting scheduled.\u201d The follow-up drafting can be constrained to use only structured fields and your approved blocks.",

Also, we can turn off model training on your data\u2014so your content isn\u2019t used to improve anything outside your tenant.

Sales_Accelerator gives you a consistent system: commit/best-case/pipeline, plus scenario planning\u2014like, \u201cIf we add 20 SQLs in Tier 1, what\u2019s the expected impact?\u201d That\u2019s hard to do reliably with dashboards and spreadsheets.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: It shouldn\u2019t duplicate. Sales_Accelerator consumes Customer_Analyzer\u2019s fit scores and positioning blocks.

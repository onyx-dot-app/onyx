      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Isabel, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned your AEs are spending a lot of time figuring out \u201cwhat do I do next?\u201d after discovery, and that deals tend to go quiet between meetings. I wanted to focus today on one piece of Sales_Accelerator\u2014our follow-up recommendations\u2014and see if it\u2019s something you could actually roll out at Novafathom.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Let me anchor it in one concrete workflow: after a discovery call, Sales_Accelerator can draft a recap email, pull in two proof points from your approved positioning library, and then generate a mutual action plan with due dates and the stakeholders you still need to engage. It\u2019s meant to reduce the \u201cblank page\u201d moment and prevent stalls.",

    {
      "text": "Isabel Patel: When you say \u201cpull proof points,\u201d that\u2019s from Customer_Analyzer, right? Because our messaging is really segmented, and we change it often.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly\u2014Sales_Accelerator sits on top of your CRM and consumes Customer_Analyzer fit scores and positioning blocks. So it\u2019s not inventing messaging from scratch; it\u2019s using what your team already approved in Customer_Analyzer. If the opportunity is mapped to, say, a specific segment, it will pick the proof points for that segment.",

    {
      "text": "Isabel Patel: That mapping part is where we\u2019ve had trouble. Our segments in Salesforce don\u2019t always line up with how marketing thinks about segments. And our \u201cpositioning blocks\u201d aren\u2019t always current\u2014some are quarterly, some are ad hoc.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s one of the main risks, yes. If segment mapping is inconsistent or the positioning blocks are stale, recommendations can feel off. In practice, what we do is start with one segment where you know the messaging is solid, confirm the field mapping from CRM to Customer_Analyzer, and only then expand. The goal is to keep the recommendations explainable\u2014your rep can see \u201cthis proof point came from this block for this segment.\u201d",

That\u2019s why the feature is designed to be more \u201cguided\u201d than \u201cauto.\u201d For example, on the recap email: it generates a draft with placeholders for what was agreed, suggests proof points, and then the rep edits before sending. Same for objections\u2014it\u2019ll propose a response aligned to your positioning, but it\u2019s not sending anything without the rep.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Good question. We\u2019re not trying to replace Outreach sequences. The part we\u2019re strong at is the decisioning: based on stage, who\u2019s engaged, whether there\u2019s a mutual plan, and recent activity, we recommend what to do next\u2014like \u201cyou had a meeting, no follow-up in 24 hours\u2014send recap + propose next meeting + add MAP.\u201d Or \u201conly one contact has responded\u2014multi-thread into procurement and the evaluator.\u201d Then we can point to your existing sequence or suggest a cadence.

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s a real concern. On our side, the way we keep it from being noisy is by limiting it to a lightweight task queue and only triggering when there\u2019s a clear gap\u2014like a meeting happened and there\u2019s no follow-up, or the mutual action plan is missing key stakeholders. It\u2019s less \u201cnotification spam\u201d and more \u201chere are your top five actions today tied to outcomes.\u201d",

      "text": "Mina Park: It will surface the gap, yes, because mutual plan completeness is a predictor of slippage. But you can tune it: for your pilot, you could define a minimal MAP\u2014like next meeting date, decision process, and at least two stakeholders. The recommendation becomes \u201cfill these three items,\u201d not a ten-step checklist. The idea is to standardize a few high-performing behaviors without forcing a full methodology overhaul.",

The integration is relatively light because we\u2019re not rebuilding ICP or duplicating objects\u2014we\u2019re consuming Customer_Analyzer outputs and reading opportunity activity. That said, we do need your segment mapping to be consistent. If your Salesforce fields are messy, it becomes work. Do you know who owns that mapping today?",

      "text": "Isabel Patel: Sales Ops owns it, but they\u2019re in the middle of a territory redesign and pipeline cleanup. And honestly, marketing updates the segments without telling sales half the time. That\u2019s part of why those positioning blocks drift.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Makes sense. The place where managers typically see value is consistency\u2014every rep gets prompted to do the basics, and the manager can coach on the same signals.

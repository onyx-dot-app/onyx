      "text": "This feature adds backend guardrails to our Issue_Tracker \u2192 Jira auto-routing and auto-creation pipeline to prevent \u201cJira spam\u201d and ownership churn. We will introduce per-workspace rate limiting and enforce strict idempotency for issue-to-Jira ticket creation so that repeated events don\u2019t translate into repeated side effects.\n\nWith these safeguards, retries, webhook replays, and dedupe/cluster updates will become safe by default: the same underlying Issue_Tracker issue will map to a single Jira issue, and repeated processing of equivalent events will no-op rather than create duplicates. Similarly, auto-routing will be protected from repeated re-routing loops that can overwhelm teams or cause confusion about ownership.\n\nThe expected impact is improved reliability and trust in automation (fewer duplicates, fewer noisy notifications, less manual cleanup), reduced load on Jira and our own backend, and clearer operational behavior during incident scenarios where upstream systems replay events. It also lowers support burden by preventing a class of high-visibility failures that are costly to remediate.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll log and surface blocked attempts with standardized reason codes (e.g., rate-limited, duplicate/idempotent hit) to enable auditing, debugging, and iterative tuning of limits by workspace. This observability ensures we can refine thresholds without guessing, and provides an explicit trail when automation intentionally suppresses an action.",

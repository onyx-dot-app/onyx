Ensure redaction is applied before persistence and before any downstream sync (e.g., Jira/Linear) while preserving referential integrity back to the source conversation where allowed. Expose redaction settings and redaction preview in the admin UI/API, including allow/deny lists and an option to store only hashed identifiers for matching/deduplication.",

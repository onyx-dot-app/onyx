      "text": "This feature adds a complete, auditable change history for all Attribution Evidence field updates on Issue objects. Every update will be recorded with the prior value, new value, timestamp, and the actor responsible (a specific user or an automated enrichment job), creating a durable trail of what changed and when.\n\nIn addition to \u201cwho/when/what,\u201d we will capture \u201cwhy/where from\u201d by attaching source provenance to each change\u2014stable references such as CRM record IDs, opportunity IDs, and conversation IDs. This is especially important for enrichment writes, where we will ensure the system stores consistent source pointers so downstream users can trace the exact originating system/object.\n\nWe will expose this history directly in the Issue detail view so sales, marketing, revops, and support stakeholders can quickly verify the evolution of attribution inputs without relying on tribal knowledge or manual investigation. This improves transparency, speeds up debugging, and enables faster resolution when attribution fields appear \u201cwrong\u201d or unexpectedly changed.\n\nOverall impact is reduced internal disputes about data origin, higher trust in attribution evidence, and better governance for downstream reporting and decision-making. By making attribution inputs explainable and verifiable, we reduce time spent on reconciliation and increase confidence in both automated enrichment and manual edits.",

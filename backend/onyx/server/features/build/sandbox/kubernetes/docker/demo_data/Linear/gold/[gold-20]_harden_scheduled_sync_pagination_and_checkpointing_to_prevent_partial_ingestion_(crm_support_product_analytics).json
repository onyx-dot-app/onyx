Implement per-connection checkpoint persistence (page/cursor + updated_at watermark) that is only advanced after a page is fully processed and committed. On retry, resume from the last committed checkpoint and ensure idempotent upserts to avoid duplicates across CRM, Support, and Product Analytics integrations.",

      "text": "This feature adds product analytics to the stale/manual positioning block detection flow so we can measure how often users paste, edit, and retain outdated `Customer_Analyzer` (CA) positioning blocks. Today, we have limited visibility into the scale of the problem and whether the warning/replacement UX is effectively driving users to the canonical content.\n\nWe will emit structured telemetry events across the full lifecycle: (1) block pasted/edited, (2) staleness check performed with result (fresh vs stale, and how stale), (3) warning shown, and (4) the user\u2019s decision (kept vs replaced). Each event will include key identifiers and context needed for funnel analysis and segmentation, including account ID, opportunity ID, and the canonical CA version/timestamp used for comparison.\n\nThe primary product impact is measurability: we can quantify adoption of the stale-block detection, identify where users drop off (e.g., warning shown but no action), and evaluate whether users are actually updating to the canonical CA content. This enables clearer prioritization (e.g., improving warning copy, adding auto-replace defaults, or tightening staleness thresholds) and supports reporting on content quality and compliance over time.\n\nTo ensure reliability, events will be validated end-to-end in staging and the event schema will be documented for downstream reporting (dashboards, analyses, and alerting). This reduces ambiguity for analytics consumers and creates a durable foundation for ongoing iteration on the positioning block experience.",

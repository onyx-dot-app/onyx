      "text": "This change ensures Sales_Accelerator only generates drafts using Customer_Analyzer messaging blocks that are explicitly approved and belong to the currently active messaging version. Today, drafts can inadvertently include unapproved or out-of-date messaging, creating compliance risk, inconsistent customer communications, and rework for Sales and RevOps.\n\nWe will update the draft generation pipeline (for both initiation and follow-up endpoints) to filter eligible content to \u201capproved + active version\u201d blocks only. This makes the behavior predictable across all draft entry points and removes ambiguity about what messaging can appear in an automated draft.\n\nWhen the target record is already in an `alignment_failed` state (as determined by the existing sync check), or when there are no approved blocks available for the expected active version, the system will not generate a draft. Instead, it will return a structured \u201cblocked\u201d response that the UI can interpret to clearly communicate why generation is unavailable and what action is needed (e.g., fix alignment, get messaging approved, or update the active version).\n\nImpact: higher trust and governance in automated drafting, reduced risk of sending incorrect or non-compliant messaging, and clearer user experience when generation cannot proceed. Tradeoffs include a potential short-term increase in \u201cblocked\u201d draft attempts until teams align on approvals and version management, but the net effect is stronger quality and consistency of outbound messaging.",

      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair\u2014and honestly that\u2019s exactly the situation Customer_Analyzer is built to de-risk. If you\u2019re open to it, I want to focus on two things only: the fit estimation output\u2014so you can align on who your best customers are with evidence\u2014and the driver breakdown\u2014so each team can see *why* a segment is high or low fit without it becoming opinion-based. Does that map to the sticking point?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Ryan Dean: That\u2019s the sticking point, yes. But we already have reports in the CRM, and Product has their own view from usage. The issue is we don\u2019t trust each other\u2019s numbers, and nobody wants another tool.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Understood. The difference here is we\u2019re not asking you to pick one team\u2019s dataset as \u201cthe truth.\u201d Customer_Analyzer ingests the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding survey answers, usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and normalizes them into a single fit score from 0 to 100 at both the account and segment level. Then it shows the top drivers contributing to that score. So instead of Sales saying \u201cbreweries like X are best\u201d and Marketing saying \u201cno, it\u2019s Y,\u201d you can point to retention, expansion, conversion, and support burden patterns across segments.",

      "text": "Ryan Dean: Okay, but practically\u2014who owns it? If Sales owns it, Marketing won\u2019t use it. If Product owns it, Sales ignores it. That\u2019s been our pattern.",

      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s a real risk. What I\u2019ve seen work is: one executive sponsor, but a shared \u201cfit council\u201d in the first month\u2014one person each from Sales, Marketing, Product. The outputs are shared artifacts: an agreed ICP profile plus two or three priority segments. In Customer_Analyzer you can literally compare segments\u2014like SMB vs mid-market\u2014side by side, with driver breakdowns. That makes the conversation about outcomes, not preferences.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: We keep it lightweight. For an initial pass, you don\u2019t need every signal type. You can start with: CRM fields for firmographics, one or two onboarding questions that reflect problem severity or willingness to pay, and one or two product usage markers that correlate with time-to-value. That\u2019s enough to generate a first fit model and show driver breakdown. Then you decide whether to add support signals or churn risk indicators later.",

Instead of \u201cit depends,\u201d you get: \u201cSegment A has a 78 fit score because time-to-value is 3 days, adoption is high, and support burden is low; Segment B is 52 because onboarding completion is low and support tickets spike.\u201d That gives Product a roadmap hypothesis, Sales a targeting plan, and Marketing a positioning angle\u2014without everyone inventing their own story.",

If someone disputes the score, you can inspect the drivers: industry, size, tech stack, problem severity proxies, adoption patterns, support burden, churn signals. And you can tune the weights transparently. We\u2019re not asking you to accept a black box.",

If you can see which segment has high retention but a consistent set of support tickets or feature requests, that\u2019s a roadmap lever. Or if a segment converts well but churns after 60 days, that\u2019s a time-to-value gap to fix. Customer_Analyzer helps connect those dots across sources\u2014usage + tickets + survey responses\u2014so Product isn\u2019t flying blind.",

      "text": "James Choi: Hi Bianca, thanks for taking a few minutes\u2014James Choi here. I know you\u2019re busy, so I\u2019ll keep this tight. I\u2019m calling because a lot of support ops teams are drowning in duplicate tickets and \u201csame issue, different wording\u201d requests, and it makes it hard to tell Product what\u2019s actually trending. We built Issue_Tracker specifically to sit between Zendesk/Intercom and Jira/Linear and turn raw customer noise into clear, prioritized issue themes. Mind if I ask how you\u2019re handling that today at Dunecrown Mining?",

    {
      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: Hi James\u2014sure. We\u2019re definitely seeing a lot of repeats, especially around a few product areas. We tag and categorize in Zendesk, and then we manually summarize for our weekly handoff to Product. It works, but it\u2019s time-consuming and we still miss patterns.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3685596-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s exactly the pain we hear. The core thing Issue_Tracker does is automatic issue clustering\u2014so it ingests tickets, chats, emails, even call-note summaries, and deduplicates them into issue clusters using semantic similarity plus rules you can control, like product area, severity, keywords, or platform. Instead of 5,000 tickets feeling like 5,000 separate problems, you end up with, say, ~80 active themes you can actually manage. When you say you miss patterns, is it because the volume is too high, or because customers describe the same issue in different ways?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3685596-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: Both. Volume is a big factor, but also people describe things differently. Sometimes they file it as a bug, sometimes as a feature request, and it splinters across tags. Then engineering thinks it\u2019s small because each bucket looks small.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Right\u2014Issue_Tracker is built to prevent that \u201cfalse smallness.\u201d The clustering creates a standardized \u201cissue object\u201d with the theme, suspected root cause category\u2014bug vs UX vs missing feature vs integration\u2014plus evidence and links back to the source conversations in Zendesk. So when you go to engineering, you\u2019re not saying \u201cwe think this matters,\u201d you\u2019re showing: here\u2019s the cluster, here are representative examples, here are the top phrases customers use, and here\u2019s the list of affected customers.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally fair. Most teams start with the automatic clustering and then do light human refinement using a merge/split workflow with guardrails. So if two clusters are basically the same, you merge; if one cluster is too broad, you split. The system suggests cluster names, highlights representative tickets, and keeps the underlying links intact so nothing becomes a dead end. The goal is: your team spends minutes curating the top themes, not hours sorting every ticket.",

    {
      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: Okay. And how does this fit with our existing process? We use Zendesk heavily, and then Jira for engineering work.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Issue_Tracker is designed to sit between them rather than replace either. Zendesk stays your system of record for support interactions; Jira stays engineering\u2019s system of record for delivery. We pull in the customer-reported inputs, cluster them into themes, and then you can route the top clusters to your weekly Product/Engineering sync with one click\u2014each cluster carries the evidence bundle and the affected customer list. Then when engineering creates or links a Jira issue, Issue_Tracker keeps that status connected back to the cluster so Support can see what\u2019s in progress, what\u2019s shipped, and what\u2019s stalled\u2014without digging through Jira tickets.",

      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: That \u201cstatus connected back\u201d part would help. Our agents get asked for updates and it\u2019s hard to give a consistent answer.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly\u2014because the issue object stays linked to both the original conversations and the downstream engineering work. So you can search, \u201cWhat\u2019s the status of the theme that\u2019s driving all these tickets?\u201d and you get a defensible history: when it was first reported, how it evolved, what decisions were made, and what\u2019s currently happening. That usually reduces internal back-and-forth and also helps you set clearer customer expectations.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Yes\u2014one very common workflow is: support ops clusters, say, 5,000 monthly tickets into around 80 active themes. During the week, the clustering updates continuously as new tickets come in. Then before the Product/Engineering weekly meeting, you take the top 10 clusters\u2014based on volume, severity, or customer impact\u2014send those over with representative examples and affected customer lists, and keep the rest as monitored themes. The team stops arguing about anecdotes and starts prioritizing based on a single shared view of \u201cwhat\u2019s happening to customers.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s the sweet spot. And because the clusters show volume and trends over time, you can say, \u201cThis issue is up 40% week-over-week,\u201d or \u201cThis theme affects these customers,\u201d with direct links back to the source tickets. It\u2019s hard to dismiss because the evidence is right there, and it\u2019s not dependent on perfect tagging discipline.",

      "text": "James Choi: Understood. The typical path is: connect Zendesk, let it ingest historical and new tickets, and within the first week you\u2019ll see clusters forming and can start using them in your handoffs. Then you tune a few rules\u2014like product areas or severity\u2014and that\u2019s usually incremental. If it\u2019s helpful, on a full call we can map your current weekly triage workflow and show what it would look like with Issue_Tracker layered in, without disrupting Zendesk or Jira.",

On the next call, we can do a quick discovery on your current categories and then walk through a sample output: how it names clusters, what it picks as representative examples, and how the merge/split workflow works when terminology is unique. If it doesn\u2019t group things the way you\u2019d expect, we\u2019ll be transparent about that.",

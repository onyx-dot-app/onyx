      "text": "This feature adds basic backend persistence and version history for outputs generated in the Positioning workspace. Each time a user generates a positioning recommendation, we will save a versioned snapshot so users can reliably return to prior outputs instead of treating results as ephemeral.\n\nSnapshots will be keyed to the workspace and segment context (including a comparison segment when applicable) and will store both history metadata and the full recommendation payload. Minimum metadata includes created_at, created_by, the segment identifiers used, and the model/run ID so teams can understand what produced a given version and trace changes over time.\n\nWe will expose APIs to (1) list versions for a given workspace/segment context, ordered most-recent-first with sensible limits, and (2) fetch a specific version by identifier. This enables product surfaces like a \u201cVersion history\u201d panel, restore/view flows, and links to share or audit prior recommendations without re-running generation.\n\nImpact: teams gain continuity and accountability\u2014supporting review cycles, comparisons between iterations, and reproducibility for stakeholder conversations. It also reduces redundant generations (time/cost) and improves trust by making the recommendation lifecycle inspectable and durable.",

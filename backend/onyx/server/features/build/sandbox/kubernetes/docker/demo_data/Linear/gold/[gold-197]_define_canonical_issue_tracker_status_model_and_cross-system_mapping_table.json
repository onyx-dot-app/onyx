Implement a status mapping table that links Zendesk/Intercom, Jira/Linear, and CRM statuses to the canonical model, including handling for missing/unknown and deprecated external statuses. Expose this mapping via configuration (seeded defaults + editable) so later sync logic can rely on a single source of truth.",

Surface a compact \u201cData Quality\u201d panel with actionable issues and suggested fixes (auto-trim/normalize casing, map common synonyms, flag low-fill-rate fields) before users finalize fit driver configuration. Persist normalization rules per workspace so subsequent ingests stay consistent without additional user effort.",

      "text": "This feature adds a backend sync job that ingests key Customer_Analyzer outputs\u2014account-level fit score, segment, and *approved* positioning blocks\u2014into Sales_Accelerator. By automatically pulling these signals into our system, we ensure Sales_Accelerator has the most current, standardized understanding of an account\u2019s fit and messaging without requiring manual copy/paste or ad hoc exports.\n\nOn the data side, we\u2019ll persist the ingested fields into a dedicated integration table/model keyed by CRM account and opportunity IDs. We\u2019ll also store source timestamps/versions so we can detect changes efficiently, avoid unnecessary writes, and support auditability (e.g., \u201cwhat data did we have at the time?\u201d).\n\nOperationally, this job establishes the foundation for downstream experiences (e.g., UI surfacing, guidance generation, rules-based workflows) by ensuring the data is reliable and consistently available. Importantly, we ingest only *approved* positioning blocks, which protects sales users from draft or unreviewed messaging and keeps downstream automation aligned with approved go-to-market guidance.\n\nTo make the integration production-ready, the sync will include basic retry/backoff behavior and logging for failures. This improves resilience to transient outages, provides visibility for debugging and alerting, and reduces the risk of stale or partially ingested Customer_Analyzer data impacting future Sales_Accelerator features.",

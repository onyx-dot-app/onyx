      "text": "Implement the recommendation layer that consumes the v3 risk score output plus the ranked driver list and returns 3\u20135 suggested interventions (with rationale, priority, and any required CRM fields/links). Recommendations should be deterministic and rule-based for v1 (e.g., \u201cschedule next meeting\u201d when next-step missing, \u201creconfirm close plan\u201d when close date slips, \u201cre-engage champion\u201d when activity decays). Add unit tests for driver-to-intervention mapping, handling of missing driver evidence, and a stable response schema for downstream UI rendering.",

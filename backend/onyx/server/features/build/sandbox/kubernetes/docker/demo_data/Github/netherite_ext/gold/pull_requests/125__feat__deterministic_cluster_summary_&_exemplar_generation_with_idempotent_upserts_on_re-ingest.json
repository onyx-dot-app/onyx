      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\n## Overview\nThis PR makes cluster summaries and representative examples deterministic and idempotent when the same source conversations are re-ingested. With stable cluster IDs/membership, re-running ingestion now produces identical summary text and stable exemplar selections, and updates existing records instead of creating duplicates.\n\n## What changed\n- **Deterministic exemplar selection**\n  - Introduces a fixed, stable ordering of candidate conversations per cluster (e.g., by `conversation_id` / `source_id` + tie-breakers).\n  - Replaces any non-deterministic sampling with a **seeded, stable selection** strategy derived from `(cluster_id, summary_version)`.\n  - Ensures exemplar outputs are stored as a stable set of selected conversation IDs.\n\n- **Deterministic summary generation inputs**\n  - Adds an explicit **versioned summary config** (prompt template version + model identifier + generation parameters).\n  - Normalizes and orders inputs fed to the LLM (stable exemplar ordering; stable context formatting).\n  - Stores the `summary_version` (and model/prompt metadata) alongside the summary for traceability.\n\n- **Idempotent persistence (upsert)**\n  - Updates the write path to **upsert per (cluster_id, summary_version)** rather than inserting new records.\n  - Prevents duplicate summary/exemplar rows on repeated ingests of the same data.\n\n## Tests\n- Adds a regression test that:\n  1. Runs ingestion on a fixed dataset.\n  2. Replays the same ingestion again.\n  3. Asserts that for every cluster the **summary text is identical** and the **exemplar conversation IDs are unchanged**, and that the DB contains a single record per `(cluster_id, summary_version)`.\n\n## Notes for reviewers / operators\n- This is a behavior change only for re-ingests with stable clustering; it should reduce churn in summaries/exemplars and eliminate duplicate records.\n- If the prompt/model needs to be updated in the future, bump `summary_version` to intentionally regenerate and persist a new set of outputs.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

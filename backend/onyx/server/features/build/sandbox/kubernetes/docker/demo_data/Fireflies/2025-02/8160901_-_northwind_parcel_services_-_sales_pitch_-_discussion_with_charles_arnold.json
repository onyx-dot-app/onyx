I work with teams that are trying to get really crisp on who their best customers are and how to message differently to each segment. Does that map to anything you\u2019re working on at Northwind Parcel Services right now?",

      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to talk about. The product is called Customer_Analyzer. In simple terms, it pulls together the customer signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even notes from calls\u2014and turns that into two things: a fit score per account/segment, and positioning recommendations you can actually use in marketing and sales.",

It\u2019s a 0\u2013100 fit score, but the key is the \u201cwhy.\u201d You define the fit drivers that matter for your business\u2014things like company size, industry, problem severity, willingness to pay, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, churn risk signals. Then it shows you the driver breakdown so you can see what\u2019s pushing a segment up or down.",

      "text": "James Choi: Perfect use case. One of the most common things customers do with us is create segment-specific landing pages and outbound messaging for two ICP tiers\u2014exactly SMB vs mid-market. The workflow looks like: we ingest your signals, we compute the fit score by segment, then we generate positioning recommendations per segment\u2014value props, differentiators, proof points, and objection handling\u2014so marketing and reps aren\u2019t re-inventing the narrative every time.",

      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s a normal starting point: Salesforce + product usage + Zendesk gets you a lot of signal. We don\u2019t need perfection on day one. Typically we start with a handful of fit drivers you already trust\u2014say size, industry, time-to-value, adoption, support burden\u2014and let the model show how those relate to outcomes. Then we refine as you add cleaner survey fields or better tagging over time.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Same. The goal is quick signal, not a six-month science project. On a first pass, many teams can get initial segment comparisons and a draft ICP recommendation in a couple weeks once data connections are in. Then you use that to run one or two experiments\u2014like updating an SMB landing page versus a mid-market page, or changing outbound talk tracks\u2014and you can see if conversion or response rates move.",

Then we run Customer_Analyzer to compare SMB vs mid-market on those drivers and outcomes. From there, we produce two sets of positioning: one for SMB, one for mid-market\u2014each with a primary value proposition, top differentiators, proof points you can substantiate, and a short objection-handling section for sales.",

      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a lightweight, configurable compliance requirements checklist that can be attached to an issue/theme and enforced as part of deployment readiness.\n\nChanges:\n- Adds a new checklist model (e.g., `complianceChecklist`) with a set of items (security review, DPA, retention constraints) where each item has: `key`, `label`, `required`, `status` (pending/complete/waived), optional `notes`, and `updatedAt/updatedBy`.\n- Extends the issue/theme schema to store an attached checklist instance and exposes a derived `complianceBlockers`/`complianceReady` flag based on required items.\n- Updates deployment readiness evaluation to fail readiness when any required checklist item is not complete (waived items do not block).\n- Exposes checklist summary + blocking status in the issue API response and in the downstream engineering link payload (Jira/Linear metadata) so teams see compliance blockers earlier.\n- Adds basic validation and defaults: if no checklist is attached, behavior is unchanged; if attached, required items default to `pending`.\n\nNotes for users:\n- Teams can attach a checklist to an issue/theme and mark specific items as required; readiness will reflect required-item completion.\n- No workflow changes for issues without an attached checklist.\n\nTesting:\n- Adds unit/integration coverage for readiness gating logic and API serialization of checklist/blocker fields.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n",

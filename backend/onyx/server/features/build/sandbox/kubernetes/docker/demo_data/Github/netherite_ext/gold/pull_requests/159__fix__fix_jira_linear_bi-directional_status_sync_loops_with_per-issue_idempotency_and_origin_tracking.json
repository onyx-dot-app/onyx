Status changes now propagate reliably without re-applying our own writes.\n\n### What changed\n- **Per-issue sync metadata** persisted alongside the integration mapping:\n  - `last_synced_state` (normalized status key used for comparisons)\n  - `last_synced_at` (timestamp of successful sync)\n  - `origin` (system that produced the last applied state: `jira` | `linear` | `issue_tracker`)\n- **Idempotent sync logic** in both directions:\n  - Normalizes inbound status \u2192 compares against `last_synced_state`\n  - **No-op** if the inbound status matches what we already synced (prevents loops)\n  - Ignores \u201cecho\u201d updates where the inbound change is attributable to our most recent outbound write (based on `origin` + state match)\n  - Still applies legitimate remote changes when the state differs (even if timestamps are close)\n- **Deterministic transition mapping**:\n  - Centralized status mapping to ensure consistent translation across systems\n  - Validates target transition exists before attempting to apply; falls back to safe handling (log + metric) when unmapped/invalid\n- **Observability**:\n  - Adds targeted logs with correlation identifiers (issue id, external key, direction, normalized states, decision outcome)\n  - Adds metrics counters for `applied`, `dropped_idempotent`, `dropped_echo`, and `conflict/unmapped_transition`\n\n### Behavior/impact\n- Prevents status \u201cping-pong\u201d between Jira/Linear and Issue_Tracker.\n- Reduces duplicate writes and rate-limit pressure by dropping idempotent/echo updates.\n- Surfaces mapping gaps and conflicting updates via logs/metrics.\n\n### Notes for reviewers\n- Focus review on the normalization + comparison logic and the decision matrix for `apply` vs `drop`.\n- Verify the status mapping table covers all expected workflow states for the supported Jira/Linear projects.\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n",

      "text": "This feature will make the deployment readiness compliance checklist context-aware by automatically determining which requirements apply based on the customer and segment details already known in our systems. By pulling attributes from CRM and Customer_Analyzer\u2014such as ICP/segment, region, and regulated/industry flags\u2014we can pre-select items like security review, DPA, and retention constraints when a theme/issue is linked to impacted customers.\n\nThe primary product impact is reducing manual triage and guesswork for PMs, Eng, and Compliance when preparing a deployment. Instead of relying on someone to remember which requirements apply for a given customer profile, the checklist will consistently reflect the derived \u201crequired for deployment\u201d set, improving accuracy and repeatability across teams and releases.\n\nWe\u2019ll also surface gaps earlier by highlighting when required items are missing or incomplete relative to the derived set. This should reduce late-stage discovery of compliance blockers, prevent last-minute launch delays, and lower the risk of deploying without meeting customer-specific obligations\u2014especially for regulated segments and non-default regions.\n\nImportantly, this delivers these benefits without changing the existing checklist UI or workflow: the same checklist remains the source of truth, but it becomes automatically pre-filled and validated based on linked customer context. This keeps adoption friction low while increasing confidence that \u201cready for deployment\u201d actually means compliant for the impacted customers.",

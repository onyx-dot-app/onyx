I work with teams that are getting swamped by support requests and internal Jira threads, and they\u2019re trying to answer a simple question: \u201cWhat customer issues actually matter most to the business right now?\u201d I wanted to quickly share how Issue_Tracker helps with that, and if it resonates we can book a deeper walkthrough.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: That\u2019s exactly where Issue_Tracker sits. It\u2019s not a replacement for Zendesk or Jira\u2014think of it as an intelligence and triage layer in between. It continuously ingests customer-reported problems from your support channels, deduplicates and clusters them into themes, and then prioritizes those clusters based on business impact\u2014like revenue exposure, segment importance, and deal risk. So instead of debating anecdote vs. anecdote, everyone looks at the same \u201cissue object\u201d with evidence and impacted customers.",

    {
      "text": "Leah Wheeler: Interesting. When you say \u201cclusters,\u201d do you mean it\u2019s automatically grouping similar tickets and requests together?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Exactly. The system pulls in the source conversations, links them to one consolidated theme or root cause, and keeps a searchable history of what was decided, why, and what\u2019s shipped. The feature most teams start with is our issue prioritization\u2014Issue_Tracker assigns an explainable priority score to each cluster. It can factor in frequency and velocity, severity tags, customer tier or ARR, churn risk flags, and which segments you care about most.",

      "text": "Leah Wheeler: \u201cExplainable\u201d is key. We\u2019ve tried scoring models before and people don\u2019t trust them because it\u2019s a black box.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Totally. Here it\u2019s transparent: you can see the inputs and tune the weighting. And we don\u2019t force one view. Support can view clusters by SLA risk, Product can view impact vs effort, Sales can view deal blockers, and Execs can view revenue exposure. Everyone\u2019s looking at the same underlying cluster, just through the lens they need.",

    {
      "text": "Leah Wheeler: Got it. Our biggest pain is follow-up consistency. We\u2019ll tell clients \u201cwe\u2019re on it,\u201d but then weeks later no one remembers who needed an update, or it\u2019s buried in a CSM\u2019s notes.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: That\u2019s one of the cleanest use cases. CSMs can subscribe accounts to relevant clusters\u2014so if Yarrowgate has five customers impacted by \u201cportfolio export timing out,\u201d those customers get attached to that cluster. When the linked Jira ticket ships, Issue_Tracker records the release milestone and creates a history trail of which customers were notified and when. It turns follow-up from a heroic manual process into a consistent workflow.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Leah Wheeler: That would help. Right now, we try to do that with Jira watchers and spreadsheets, and it\u2019s messy. How does it connect to Jira? We\u2019re pretty standardized there.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7520693-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: We integrate directly. The cluster stays linked to the downstream engineering work item\u2014Jira or Linear\u2014so Product and Engineering keep working where they already are. Issue_Tracker just standardizes the \u201cissue object\u201d and keeps it connected to the original customer evidence and the impacted account list. So when Jira status changes, your CS team can see it immediately, and the system can prompt or automate notifications based on your process.",

    {
      "text": "Leah Wheeler: And the prioritization\u2014can it incorporate customer tier and segment? Because we have institutional clients where an issue carries way more weight than, say, smaller accounts.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Yes. That\u2019s actually where it becomes most valuable. You can weight by ARR and customer tier, and also by ICP/segment importance. So if an issue hits a high-fit segment\u2014like institutional workflows\u2014it rises, even if the raw ticket volume is smaller. The goal is to prevent the \u201cloudest wins\u201d dynamic and instead align on business-grounded logic.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Exactly. The shared issue model reduces that tension because you can say, \u201cHere\u2019s the cluster, here\u2019s how many customers, here\u2019s which segments, here\u2019s ARR at risk, and here\u2019s the velocity.\u201d Then the debate shifts from \u201cis this real?\u201d to \u201cwhat do we do about it?\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Minimal to start. Typically we connect your support channel and Jira first, then configure a baseline priority model\u2014frequency/velocity, severity, tier/ARR. If you want, we add segment weighting using your CRM fields. The clustering starts immediately because it\u2019s based on incoming ticket text and metadata; you can refine it over time, but you don\u2019t need a perfect taxonomy on day one.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Good question. We can ingest the relevant ticket content and metadata needed for clustering and evidence, and we support controls around what\u2019s stored and how it\u2019s accessed. On a longer call we can go through your requirements and our options\u2014many teams choose to store references plus curated excerpts, depending on policy.",

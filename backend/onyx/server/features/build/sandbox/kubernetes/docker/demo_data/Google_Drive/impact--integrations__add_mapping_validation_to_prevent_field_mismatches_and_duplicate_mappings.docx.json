      "text": "This feature adds pre-save validation to our integrations field-mapping UI and API so we catch configuration issues before they create downstream failures. Today, incorrect mappings often only surface after sync begins, leading to hard-to-diagnose errors, duplicate or missing data, and noisy \u201csignals\u201d that undermine trust in the integration.\n\nWith this change, we will block saving mappings that are structurally invalid: mismatched data types between source and destination fields, missing required source fields, and duplicate/ambiguous mappings (e.g., multiple source fields mapped to the same destination field, or a destination mapped multiple times). Validation will run consistently across UI and API to prevent invalid states regardless of entry point.\n\nWhen a user attempts to save an invalid mapping, we will surface clear, actionable error messages that pinpoint the exact fields in conflict (e.g., \u201cDestination \u2018Email\u2019 is mapped twice: \u2018Work Email\u2019 and \u2018Personal Email\u2019\u201d or \u201cSource field required for \u2018Account ID\u2019 is missing\u201d). This turns trial-and-error into a guided fix, reducing support burden and time-to-success for setup.\n\nImpact-wise, we expect fewer integration-related mapping failures, fewer duplicate signals caused by conflicting mappings, and higher reliability of synced data from day one. It also creates a stronger foundation for future mapping features by enforcing correctness at the boundary, rather than relying on downstream processing to handle inconsistent configurations.",

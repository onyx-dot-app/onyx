I\u2019ll keep this quick: I wanted to share how Sales_Accelerator helps teams turn what\u2019s in the CRM into an explainable forecast and clear next steps, without ripping out Salesforce or rebuilding your ICP work.",

      "text": "Addison Simmons: Hi Megan\u2014sure, I\u2019ve got a few minutes. We\u2019re definitely interested in anything that improves forecasting, but we\u2019ve already invested a lot in our CRM process. What exactly do you mean by \u201cexecution layer\u201d?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3614342-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair. Think of Sales_Accelerator as a layer on top of your CRM that reads your existing opportunity stages plus real activity signals\u2014emails, calls, meetings, stage age\u2014and then produces an opportunity-level and pipeline-level forecast you can actually defend. It doesn\u2019t replace your workflow; it diagnoses what\u2019s happening and why. And if you\u2019re using something like Customer_Analyzer for fit scoring, we can consume that as a weighting factor so Tier 1 opportunities show up appropriately in commit/best-case views.",

      "text": "Addison Simmons: Okay. We\u2019re on Salesforce, and right now our forecast meetings are\u2026 a lot of manual judgment. But we\u2019ve tried forecasting tools before and they\u2019re usually black boxes, which leadership hates. How is this different?",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: The \u201cblack box\u201d problem is exactly what we built against. Our forecast is explainable via drivers\u2014so for any deal, you can see what\u2019s pushing it toward commit or pushing it out: stage age relative to benchmarks, last touch, whether a next meeting is scheduled, activity trend, and optionally fit tier and historical win rate for similar deals. So instead of \u201cthe model says no,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthis deal is at risk because it\u2019s 18 days past typical stage time and there\u2019s no meeting on the calendar.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly\u2014Sales_Accelerator breaks forecast and slippage diagnostics down by segment, rep, and source. So you can see, for example, \u201cMid-market aerospace suppliers convert from discovery to proposal at X% but enterprise is stalling,\u201d or \u201cRep A has a consistent stage 3 slip pattern.\u201d Then it ties that to conversion and cycle-time benchmarks so you can pinpoint where the bottleneck is forming\u2014not just that it exists.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s a perfect example and it maps directly to a common use case we see with sales ops. Sales_Accelerator shows stage-to-stage conversion by segment and rep, then highlights where deals slow or drop. If the data shows deals that eventually go through security review are slipping late-stage, it will recommend process adjustments\u2014like pulling the security review step earlier, or adding a defined checkpoint in stage 2\u2014then you can monitor whether that bottleneck improves quarter over quarter.",

If you\u2019re already tracking emails and meetings through your existing tools, we can use that. The goal is to reflect reality, not force new behavior. And when activity is missing, the system doesn\u2019t just fail\u2014it flags where the forecast confidence is lower and why.",

Managers get a deal-by-deal \u201cwhat changed since last week\u201d view and the drivers behind the forecast. The point is to make forecast calls less about arguing opinions and more about addressing the few deals that are truly off-pattern.",

A simple example: \u201cIf we add 20 SQLs in ICP Tier 1, what\u2019s the expected impact on pipeline and likely closed-won by end of quarter?\u201d It uses your historical conversion and cycle-time benchmarks, and, if available, fit tier weighting.

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Messy data is common, and we handle it in two ways. First, we surface where inconsistency is affecting outputs\u2014like a rep who skips a stage or reopens deals frequently. Second, because the forecast blends stage data with activity signals and benchmarks, it\u2019s more resilient than stage-only forecasting. In a lot of cases, the tool actually helps you identify where the process needs tightening because you\u2019ll see the variance in stage duration and conversion by team.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Understood. The typical path is: connect to Salesforce and activity sources, then in the first couple of weeks you\u2019ll have baseline forecast views and slippage diagnostics. After that, you start tuning\u2014segment definitions, benchmarks, optional fit-score weighting if you have Customer_Analyzer. The earliest value tends to be \u201cwe finally see which stages are leaking and which deals are objectively stale.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally optional. If you have a fit tier or score, we can ingest it. If you don\u2019t, Sales_Accelerator still works off activity signals, stage, and historical outcomes. The fit weighting just makes prioritization and forecasting more nuanced\u2014especially when you\u2019re comparing similar-stage deals with different likelihoods to convert.",

Two: bottleneck identification and remediation\u2014can we pinpoint a stage where deals stall, recommend a process fix, and then track whether conversion and cycle time improve. For managers, we\u2019d also look at whether the \u201cdrivers\u201d reduce time spent debating and increase time spent taking actions on at-risk deals.",

What I\u2019d suggest is a longer working session\u2014say 45 minutes\u2014where we map your current stages, how you run forecasting today, and what segments matter most at Riverstone Aeroworks. Then we can show a tailored view of commit/best-case/pipeline and the slippage diagnostics you\u2019d expect to see, plus a scenario planning example relevant to your QBR.",

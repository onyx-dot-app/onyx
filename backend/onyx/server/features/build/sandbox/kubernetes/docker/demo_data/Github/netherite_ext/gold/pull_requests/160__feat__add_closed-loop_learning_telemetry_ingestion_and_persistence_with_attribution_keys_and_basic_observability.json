Events are validated on ingest and persisted with joinable attribution keys so downstream aggregation/attribution can reliably join outcomes to recommendations and CRM entities.\n\n## What changed\n- **New ingestion API**: Adds a POST endpoint (versioned under the existing API namespace) to accept closed-loop outcome events.\n- **Schema validation**: Validates payloads against the GOLD-106 canonical schema (required fields, type checks, enum constraints, and basic value sanity).\n- **Durable storage**: Persists validated events in a new database table/collection designed for analytics-friendly querying.\n  - Stores **join keys** explicitly and indexed for downstream joins:\n    - `recommendation_instance_id`\n    - `account_id` / `opportunity_id`\n    - CRM identifiers (e.g., `crm_account_id`, `crm_opportunity_id`)\n    - segmentation/ownership fields (e.g., `segment`, `rep_id`, `motion`)\n  - Uses idempotency/deduping where supported (event id / source id) to avoid double writes.\n\n## Observability (minimal)\n- Adds metrics:\n  - invalid event counter (by validation failure reason)\n  - ingest latency histogram/timer\n  - dropped/failed ingest counter\n- Adds structured logs for:\n  - validation failures (with redaction of sensitive fields)\n  - persistence errors\n  - dedupe/drop decisions\n\n## Behavior and safety\n- Ingestion failures **do not block** or impact core recommendation workflows; endpoint is isolated and failures are handled with non-fatal error paths.\n- Invalid events are rejected with a clear 4xx response; server/persistence issues return 5xx and are logged/metric\u2019d.\n\n## Notes for reviewers/operators\n- Includes DB migration for the new events storage and indexes on the primary join keys.\n- Configuration supports enabling/disabling ingestion via feature flag/env toggle if needed.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

      "text": "\u201cSimple Mode\u201d introduces a low-configuration default onboarding path that lets first-time users get value without understanding or tuning the full alert/template/model surface area. On first run, the system will automatically preselect a minimal, recommended configuration designed for small teams, while preserving an explicit path to switch into \u201cAdvanced\u201d mode later.\n\nThe primary user impact is faster time-to-value and fewer setup errors: new admins can start with a known-good baseline that enables only core Sales_Accelerator workflows (forecasting, next-best-action, and risk alerts). By defaulting to Customer_Analyzer fit/positioning inputs, teams can see relevant outputs immediately without manual model selection, alert wiring, or template customization.\n\nFrom a product and operational standpoint, this reduces onboarding friction and support burden by standardizing the initial state and minimizing the number of decisions required at setup. It also creates a clearer progression: Simple Mode for adoption and early wins, followed by Advanced mode for teams that need deeper customization, improving retention by aligning complexity with readiness.\n\nScope-wise, this ticket focuses on backend/default configuration and state management to ensure the correct defaults are applied, persisted, and safely upgradable as users transition modes. UI surfacing, education, and progressive disclosure are intentionally deferred to subsequent tickets, enabling engineering to establish a reliable foundation that the UI can later reflect and control.",

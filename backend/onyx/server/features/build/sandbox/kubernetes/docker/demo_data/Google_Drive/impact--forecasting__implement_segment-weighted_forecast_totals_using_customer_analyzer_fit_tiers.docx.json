      "text": "This feature adds segment-weighted forecast totals to our forecasting aggregation pipeline by applying configurable weights based on the Customer_Analyzer \u201cfit tier\u201d (e.g., A/B/C). Instead of treating all opportunities equally, we\u2019ll adjust opportunity amounts/probabilities by tier weight and then roll them up to produce weighted totals that better reflect expected performance by customer segment.\n\nFrom a product impact perspective, this improves forecast accuracy and trust for GTM leaders by incorporating a consistent, centrally-defined \u201cquality\u201d signal into topline numbers. It also enables faster iteration on forecasting strategy (tuning tier weights) without changing the UI or requiring per-report logic, making the system more adaptable as our understanding of segment performance evolves.\n\nOn the platform/API side, we\u2019ll expose both raw and weighted totals via the forecast API. This ensures the UI can render toggles or side-by-side views (raw vs weighted) while keeping the logic authoritative in the backend, reducing duplication, inconsistency risk, and maintenance overhead across clients.\n\nThe weighting will work across existing scenario buckets (baseline/commit/best-case) so teams can compare scenarios apples-to-apples under the same weighting scheme. When a fit tier is missing, the system will fall back gracefully (e.g., default/unweighted behavior) to avoid breaking totals and to keep results stable while data quality improves.",

      "text": "James Choi: Totally get it\u2014I\u2019ll keep it tight. I\u2019m calling because we work with revenue teams that live in Salesforce or HubSpot and are trying to get more consistent deal follow-through and forecasting without adding another system. Our product is called Sales_Accelerator, and it sits on top of your CRM to recommend the best next action on each opportunity and alert you when deals are at risk.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That makes sense. The quick distinction is: dashboards tell you what happened; Sales_Accelerator tells reps what to do next\u2014right inside the CRM. One feature that tends to resonate is our sales follow-up recommendations. For example, if a meeting happened but there\u2019s no follow-up logged, it will prompt a recap email plus concrete next steps, and it\u2019ll nudge the rep to put dates on a mutual action plan so deals don\u2019t drift.",

    {
      "text": "Tyler Wheeler: Okay. But we\u2019ve tried \u201cnext best action\u201d stuff before. It ends up being noise, and reps ignore it.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Fair pushback. We\u2019ve seen that too when recommendations are generic. Our approach is more contextual: it looks at the opportunity stage, stakeholder coverage\u2014like whether you\u2019re single-threaded\u2014mutual plan completeness, and recent activity. If it sees only one contact engaged late in the cycle, it\u2019ll recommend multi-threading and suggest a simple task queue, like \u201cadd procurement,\u201d \u201cloop in security,\u201d \u201cschedule exec alignment,\u201d based on what usually prevents stalls.",

This is lightweight\u2014think \u201chere are the two actions most likely to move this deal forward\u201d rather than \u201cfill out 20 fields.\u201d And sales ops can use it too. One use case we see a lot: sales ops identifies pipeline bottlenecks by stage-to-stage conversion, segmented by rep or segment, and then the system recommends process fixes\u2014like introducing a security review step earlier\u2014then monitors whether conversion improves.",

If you have opportunities with stages, contacts, and activities in Salesforce, the recommendations still apply. Quick question: do you have a consistent issue where deals sit in a stage longer than expected?",

That said, it can sometimes help highlight where the process breaks\u2014like if reps aren\u2019t logging meetings or next steps\u2014and give you visibility into those gaps. But I don\u2019t want to force-fit it if you\u2019re prioritizing cleanup.",

      "text": "James Choi: I hear you. Let me keep this to what might be worth a follow-up: the follow-up recommendations are designed to reduce rep effort, not increase it\u2014like generating a recap-and-next-steps prompt when a meeting occurred without a follow-up, or reminding them to lock mutual next steps. But if adoption is the concern, it\u2019s probably not the right timing unless there\u2019s a specific pain\u2014like forecasting accuracy or deals slipping late.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. Last time you said two things mattered most for Pebble & Pine: more reliable forecasting without chasing reps, and making sure AEs consistently run clean follow-ups after discovery so deals don\u2019t stall. I\u2019d like to focus on two parts of Sales_Accelerator that map directly to that: the sales_forecast and the post-discovery follow-up recommendations. Sound right?",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Great. On forecasting: Sales_Accelerator sits on top of your CRM\u2014so you keep Salesforce as the system of record\u2014but we add an execution layer that uses more than just stage. We combine stage data with activity signals\u2014emails, calls, meetings\u2014plus cycle-time benchmarks. If you want, we also weight the forecast using your Customer_Analyzer fit score, so ICP deals don\u2019t get treated the same as non-ICP deals.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. The output is the views you\u2019re used to\u2014commit, best-case, pipeline\u2014but what\u2019s different is it\u2019s explainable. So when your VP asks, \u201cWhy did commit drop?\u201d you can see drivers like: stage age is beyond benchmark, no meeting scheduled, last touch was 12 days ago, or it\u2019s a lower fit tier with historically lower win rates. That\u2019s usually where teams get forecast accuracy and fewer end-of-quarter surprises.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair\u2014and that\u2019s why we built the drivers panel. For any opportunity, it literally shows the factors impacting the forecast. For example: \u201cNext meeting scheduled\u201d is a positive driver; \u201cstage age above benchmark\u201d is a negative driver. And at the pipeline level you can slice by segment, rep, and source and see stage conversion and slippage diagnostics\u2014like which stages are leaking and which reps are consistently slipping from commit to best-case.",

You mentioned AEs do discovery, then the follow-up email quality varies and mutual action plans are inconsistent.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: You\u2019re spot on. There are two known failure modes: if the Customer_Analyzer positioning blocks aren\u2019t kept current, or if the segment mapping between systems is inconsistent. We handle that in two ways. First, during implementation we confirm the segment taxonomy and map it cleanly between Customer_Analyzer and Salesforce so the right blocks trigger for the right accounts. Second, we set a lightweight monthly check\u2014usually 30 minutes with whoever owns messaging\u2014to review whether any positioning blocks need refreshing based on what\u2019s working in-market.",

Implementation is two weeks: week one is Salesforce connection, activity signal integration, and segment mapping to Customer_Analyzer; week two is configuring cycle-time benchmarks and rolling out the AE post-discovery workflow.

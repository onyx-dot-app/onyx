I\u2019ll focus on two things today: the Fit Estimation feature\u2014how we compute and explain a fit score\u2014and the segment comparisons that let you stack industries against each other using retention and support signals. Then we\u2019ll talk about data quality and what \u201cgood enough\u201d looks like to start.",

You can define fit drivers you care about\u2014like industry, company size, problem severity, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, churn risk signals\u2014and we\u2019ll show exactly which drivers pushed a segment up or down.",

For your use case\u2014prioritizing industries next quarter\u2014we typically set a heavier weight on retention and support burden, with a secondary weight on time-to-value and expansion. That way you\u2019re not just picking \u201cwho converts,\u201d you\u2019re picking \u201cwho sticks and grows without crushing your team.\u201d",

You can compare, say, \u201cAgency Marketing\u201d vs \u201cSaaS Marketing\u201d vs \u201cE-commerce\u201d and see: average fit score, retention outcomes, support tickets per account, and the main drivers.

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Good question\u2014and I want to be direct: data quality does affect scoring accuracy. But you don\u2019t need perfect data to get value. We handle this in three ways. First, we ingest multiple signal sources so you\u2019re not relying on one messy system\u2014CRM plus support tickets plus product usage events, for example. Second, we show data coverage per driver so you can see where you\u2019re making decisions with high confidence versus \u201cneeds cleanup.\u201d Third, we can start with a minimal driver set that you have reliably today, and expand over time.",

      "text": "Mina Park: For Vividcedar, based on what you shared: (1) industry and size from CRM\u2014even if imperfect, we can normalize and map common variants; (2) retention outcome\u2014renewed, churned, expanded\u2014however you track it; and (3) support burden from your ticketing system\u2014ticket volume and tags. If we have those three, you can already rank industries for next quarter with more rigor than you have today.",

And to avoid the \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d worry, we\u2019ll set up the initial model with conservative assumptions. If a segment has low data coverage, the system flags it, and the score reflects uncertainty rather than pretending it\u2019s precise.",

      "text": "Mina Park: And the answer is: you trust it because it\u2019s explainable. When your VP asks \u201cWhy is e-commerce lower fit than SaaS?\u201d, you can point to the driver breakdown: maybe higher support burden and lower retention outweigh slightly better conversion.

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Two core outputs. First, the fit score at the account and segment level\u2014so your team can look at industries, sizes, even subsegments if you want. Second, positioning recommendations that translate the insights into messaging: value propositions, differentiators, proof points, and objection handling. For today, since we\u2019re trying to get your Q2 industry priority locked, the fit estimation and segment comparisons are the main drivers. Then we can use the positioning piece to arm sales and marketing with a narrative for the chosen industries.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. That\u2019s the \u201cclose the loop\u201d motion: prioritize, then message. One practical example: if a segment scores high because time-to-value is short and support burden is low, we\u2019ll recommend messaging that leans into fast onboarding and low operational overhead\u2014with proof points pulled from your best-fit customers.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Week 1: connect data sources\u2014CRM, support ticketing, and product usage if you want it now or later. Week 2: define your initial fit drivers and weights\u2014especially retention and support burden for your use case\u2014and run a first scoring pass. Week 3: review segment comparison results with you and one stakeholder from sales/CS to sanity check. Week 4: lock the \u201crecommended ICP profile\u201d and export it into your planning docs, plus the initial positioning recommendations for the top two industries.",

Given your stated goal\u2014industry prioritization next quarter\u2014the essential scope is Fit Estimation plus segment comparisons, connected to CRM and support tickets. We can start there, and add more data sources or deeper positioning workflows after you\u2019ve proven impact. If you\u2019re ready to move forward today, I can send an order form with that scope and a 12-month term, and we can aim to kick off next Tuesday.",

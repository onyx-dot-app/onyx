      "text": "This change upgrades our positioning recommendation generator from \u201cbest-guess\u201d outputs to evidence-led positioning by explicitly retrieving the most relevant captured customer language for a target segment and threading that evidence through value props, differentiators, and objection handling. The immediate impact is higher trust and usability: users will see recommendations that reflect what customers actually said, not generic marketing phrasing, and they can confidently reuse language in decks, webpages, and sales scripts.\n\nAdding lightweight citations (source type + artifact reference) materially improves transparency and collaboration. PMM, sales, and product teams can quickly validate claims, trace them back to interviews/call snippets/surveys, and align on messaging faster\u2014reducing back-and-forth and minimizing the risk of shipping positioning that can\u2019t be defended. It also supports better internal adoption because outputs become \u201caudit-able\u201d and shareable.\n\nGraceful degradation when evidence is sparse (explicitly flagging low-evidence recommendations) reduces the likelihood of misleading or overly broad claims. Instead of silently filling gaps with generic assertions, the system will communicate confidence, prompting users to either collect more evidence or treat the output as a hypothesis. This improves quality, reduces reputational risk, and helps prioritize research efforts.\n\nFinally, guardrails that prevent uncited assertions when evidence exists will raise the baseline quality of all generated positioning and reinforce the product\u2019s core promise: capturing and operationalizing customer voice. Over time, this should increase engagement with evidence capture, improve retention among PMM-heavy accounts, and create a compounding loop where better evidence leads to better positioning, which drives more reliance on the product.",

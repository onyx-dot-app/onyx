      "text": "Megan Foster: Hi Oscar, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re getting a lot of \u201csomething\u2019s broken\u201d messages coming in from Zendesk and Intercom, and then your team has to translate that into Jira tickets\u2014often with duplicates and unclear impact. Today I\u2019d love to focus on how Issue_Tracker can help you get to a clear \u201cwhat do we fix next\u201d list that both Support and Engineering trust. Does that still match what\u2019s most urgent?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Oscar Fuentes: Yeah, that\u2019s still the pain. We\u2019re spending too much time figuring out if an issue is real, how many customers it\u2019s hitting, and whether it\u2019s actually hurting revenue. It\u2019s noisy.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. Let\u2019s zoom in on one capability: issue_prioritization. The core idea is Issue_Tracker clusters similar customer-reported issues across your channels, then ranks those clusters with an explainable score\u2014so you can see, \u201cThis is high because it\u2019s spiking in volume, tagged severe, hitting high-ARR customers, and it\u2019s tied to churn risk or a late-stage deal.\u201d Where are you prioritizing today\u2014Support SLA, Product impact/effort, or Sales deal blockers?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Oscar Fuentes: Honestly, it\u2019s a mix and that\u2019s part of the problem. Support escalates what\u2019s loud. Product tries to be rational. And Sales only jumps in when a deal is at risk. There\u2019s no shared logic.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s exactly the gap Issue_Tracker is meant to close. It doesn\u2019t replace Zendesk or Jira\u2014it sits between them and standardizes the \u201cissue object\u201d: the theme or root cause, evidence from real conversations, and the list of impacted customers. Then prioritization gives each team a view that matches how they work: Support can see SLA-risk clusters, Engineering can see trend velocity and representative examples, and leadership can see revenue exposure.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Oscar Fuentes: The \u201cevidence\u201d part is interesting. Engineering always asks, \u201cIs this one customer, or is it widespread?\u201d And then someone has to go hunting across tickets.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. For engineering managers, one of the most used workflows is opening a cluster and seeing: top examples, platform or channel breakdown, trend line over time, and which customers are affected. So before someone gets paged or you spin up an on-call fix, they can validate whether it\u2019s actually widespread and getting worse.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-7"
    },
    {
      "text": "Oscar Fuentes: That would help. But I\u2019m a little worried about clustering accuracy. If the system merges different issues because customers describe them similarly, or splits one issue into five clusters because the language varies, we\u2019ll lose trust fast.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair\u2014and it\u2019s the right concern to raise on call two. Two things we do to protect trust. First, the priority score is explainable even if clustering needs tuning\u2014you can see why something is ranking high and inspect the evidence. Second, we build in a \u201ccluster hygiene\u201d workflow: your team can quickly merge or split clusters, and Issue_Tracker learns from that feedback. In practice, we typically start with your top few categories\u2014like checkout errors, delivery scheduling, or account access\u2014so we tune where it matters most.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3894723-9"

    {
      "text": "Oscar Fuentes: Okay. How much effort is that tuning? I don\u2019t have someone who can babysit this daily.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: You shouldn\u2019t need to. In week one, we do a short calibration pass\u2014usually 60\u201390 minutes with someone from Support Ops or Product Ops\u2014to review the top clusters and correct the obvious merges/splits. After that, it\u2019s light-touch: your team only adjusts when they notice something off, and those adjustments reduce future errors. The goal is \u201cgood enough to drive decisions,\u201d not perfection.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Yes. Issue_Tracker integrates with your CRM so we can weight clusters by ARR tier, segment, and deal stage. So if an issue is impacting, say, your highest-value wholesale floral accounts\u2014or it\u2019s showing up in conversations tied to late-stage opportunities\u2014it gets boosted. That\u2019s where the prioritization becomes more than \u201cmost frequent\u201d; it becomes \u201cmost important to the business.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. Frequency alone misses that. The score can incorporate severity tags, velocity, tier/ARR, and churn risk flags\u2014so you can configure it to match how Wisp & Willow thinks about impact.

What\u2019s hitting premium customers?\u201d Then, when they escalate, they escalate the cluster\u2014complete with evidence and impacted accounts\u2014rather than forwarding five separate tickets and a Slack summary.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. The cluster stays linked to the downstream Jira issue or epic, and it stays linked back to the original Zendesk/Intercom conversations. That means you have a defensible history of decisions: when it was identified, why it was prioritized, what work was done, and current status. That\u2019s huge for internal alignment and for customer follow-up.",

And since this is your second call, I want to connect it to the business outcome you mentioned last time\u2014reducing fire drills and preventing revenue surprises. With issue_prioritization, you can build an Exec view that answers, \u201cWhat issues are exposing revenue right now?\u201d and a Sales view for deal blockers.

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Great. Let me sanity-check your top use case. You said Engineering wants to validate if a bug is real and widespread before committing an on-call fix. If we set this up, your engineering manager can open a cluster and immediately see representative examples, platform breakdown, and velocity\u2014so they know if it\u2019s escalating.

      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. The other success metric I\u2019d suggest is agreement: Support and Engineering align on the top 5 issues without a 30-minute debate. Because the ranking is explainable\u2014\u201cthis is high because it\u2019s severe, rising fast, and impacting high-tier customers\u201d\u2014it reduces the \u201cloudest voice wins\u201d problem.",

First, we\u2019ll focus on a narrow slice\u2014your top 2\u20133 categories\u2014so accuracy is high where you\u2019re looking most. Second, we\u2019ll create a simple feedback loop: when Engineering says \u201cthis cluster is mixed,\u201d we split it and mark the patterns. You\u2019ll see the quality improve quickly, and we\u2019ll review the before/after together at the end of week two.",

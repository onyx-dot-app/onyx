      "text": "Megan Foster: Hi David, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re getting hit with repeat \u201csame problem\u201d tickets from different districts and it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s actually widespread versus just noisy. I wanted to focus today on Issue_Tracker\u2014specifically the issue clustering piece\u2014and how it ties back to protecting late-stage deals.",

    {
      "text": "David Green: Hey Megan. Yeah, that\u2019s still the pain. Support says it\u2019s everywhere, product says it\u2019s isolated, and sales is stuck in the middle trying to explain what\u2019s going on to prospects.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3310916-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. So Issue_Tracker sits between Zendesk or Intercom and your internal tools like Jira, and it standardizes an \u201cissue object\u201d\u2014a theme with evidence, impacted customers, and linked source conversations. The most immediate win is issue_clustering: it automatically groups related tickets, chats, and call-note summaries into deduped clusters, so you stop triaging the same thing ten times under ten different labels.",

    {
      "text": "David Green: Okay. We already tag tickets and we have macros. The problem is we don\u2019t trust the tags, and we still end up with spreadsheets when leadership asks \u201chow big is this?\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s a common pattern. Clustering gives you a defensible view: the cluster shows top phrases, representative examples, suggested naming, and it keeps the links back to each Zendesk ticket or Intercom thread. If someone questions \u201cis this real,\u201d you can open the cluster and see the underlying evidence\u2014who said it, when, and from which channel.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Fair. The default workflow is mostly automated, but with guardrails: it proposes merges and splits, and you can set rules by product area, platform, severity keywords\u2014so you\u2019re not mixing \u201cmobile login\u201d with \u201cSIS integration,\u201d for example. Usually a support lead or ops person spends a short weekly pass reviewing the clusters that are ambiguous; the rest runs on autopilot.",

    {
      "text": "David Green: The weekly pass sounds like \u201csomeone\u2019s job now.\u201d Also, our org is sensitive to anything that looks like an algorithm telling them what\u2019s important. That came up with a previous vendor.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: I want to separate two things. Clustering is about deduping and making volume visible\u2014less about telling you what to do. The prioritization layer can be configured, but we don\u2019t need to lead with that today. For Prairielark, the use case you flagged was deal risk: sales wants a clean answer when a late-stage prospect hits a known issue. That\u2019s where linking an opportunity to an issue cluster helps\u2014sales sees current status, internal notes, and safe-to-say language, instead of chasing product in Slack.",

    {
      "text": "David Green: Linking opportunities sounds great in theory. In practice, we\u2019ve been burned. People argue about severity versus frequency. And if the score is a black box, product will ignore it and create their own list.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally. When teams feel it\u2019s a black box, they revert to parallel spreadsheets. What we do is make the weighting explicit: you can show the components\u2014frequency, affected segment, revenue exposure\u2014so if leadership wants to adjust ARR weighting for enterprise districts, you do it transparently.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Understood. If the goal is fewer debates, one approach is to treat Issue_Tracker as the single source of evidence, not the single source of priority. So: clustering produces the facts\u2014what\u2019s being reported, by whom, how often, what it\u2019s tied to\u2014and your existing process decides priority. Then later, if you want, you can layer in impact scoring.",

    {
      "text": "David Green: That might be more acceptable. But I\u2019m still worried about accuracy. Education customers describe the same issue in wildly different terms. If the clustering is off, it\u2019ll either undercount or lump unrelated stuff together.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s exactly why we use semantic similarity instead of pure keyword matching, and why there\u2019s a merge/split workflow. If two clusters are actually the same root cause\u2014say \u201cgrade passback failing\u201d and \u201cSIS sync error\u201d\u2014the system will suggest a merge based on overlapping phrases and linked components, but your team approves it. And if it lumps unrelated issues, you split it and the model learns from those decisions.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Practically, we recommend starting with a narrow scope. For example: pick one product area\u2014maybe SIS integrations since that\u2019s where districts get loud\u2014and run clustering only there for 30 days. You validate: do the clusters match what your support lead already knows? Are you seeing duplicates collapse? If it\u2019s not accurate enough, you don\u2019t roll it out broadly.",

Issue_Tracker becomes the connective tissue: Zendesk stays Zendesk, Jira stays Jira, but the \u201cissue object\u201d and its history stop being scattered.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Totally fair. Let me frame today around two things: first, how Customer_Analyzer helps your product planning team identify high\u2011fit customers with unmet needs for roadmap bets; second, how the positioning recommendations turn that into usable messaging for sales and marketing. And then we\u2019ll decide if the timing is right. Sound okay?",

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: That\u2019s the right place to dig in. On the product planning side, the core output is the fit score by segment\u2014so you can see, for example, \u201cthis industry + company size + workflow pattern\u201d is disproportionately successful and sticks around, versus \u201cthis other segment churns or never activates.\u201d But the fit score quality depends on signals: CRM fields, onboarding surveys, usage events, support tickets, notes\u2014whatever you can provide.",

    {
      "text": "Audrey Rogers: Right, and our issue is we have missing fields and inconsistent tagging. We\u2019ve got Salesforce fields that reps don\u2019t always fill in, and product events are decent but not mapped cleanly to customer outcomes.",

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Understood. Two things we do to mitigate that. First, we don\u2019t rely on one source\u2014so sparse CRM can be offset by stronger product usage and support patterns. Second, we show the \u201cfit drivers\u201d and evidence behind the score. So instead of a black box, you can see what\u2019s contributing: activation time, retention behaviors, ticket themes, survey language\u2014whatever is present. That way, even if the score isn\u2019t perfect on day one, teams can decide if it\u2019s directionally trustworthy.",

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: That\u2019s where the positioning recommendation feature helps too, because it explicitly links messaging back to the drivers and evidence used. For a prioritized segment, it generates an editable block: segment\u2011specific value prop, top use cases, differentiators, proof points to collect, pricing/value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook. And each line ties back to actual observed customer language\u2014support tickets, interview notes, survey responses.",

In your case, I was thinking we start narrow: pick one segment you already suspect is high-fit, and one you suspect is noisy or low-fit. We can run Customer_Analyzer against those with the data you have, generate positioning for the high-fit segment, and use the proof-points list to systematically fill gaps\u2014like \u201ccollect 3 quotes about X objection,\u201d or \u201ctrack Y usage event.\u201d",

For onboarding, we typically need: a CRM export with whatever fields you trust, a mapping to accounts, and a product events feed\u2014or even a weekly export to start. If you don\u2019t have clean tags, we can still create a basic segment model with what\u2019s there, and flag confidence levels. But yes\u2014if fields are missing, scoring accuracy drops.",

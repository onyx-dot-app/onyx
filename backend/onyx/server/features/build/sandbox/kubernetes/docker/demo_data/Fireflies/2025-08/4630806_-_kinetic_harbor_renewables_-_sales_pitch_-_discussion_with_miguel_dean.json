      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. I\u2019m calling because we work with revenue teams that already live in Salesforce or HubSpot but still struggle with two things: forecasting that nobody trusts, and SDRs spending time on the wrong accounts. Our product, Sales_Accelerator, sits on top of your CRM and turns your existing signals\u2014stages, activity, meetings\u2014into an explainable forecast and a \u201cwhat to do next\u201d list.",

    {
      "text": "Miguel Dean: We already have Salesforce dashboards for forecasting. And our SDRs have sequences. So what\u2019s different?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair. The difference is we don\u2019t just summarize pipeline\u2014Sales_Accelerator combines your CRM stage data with real activity signals like last touch, meeting scheduled, stage age, and cycle-time benchmarks to predict commit/best-case/pipeline in a way you can actually defend. Then it shows the drivers behind the number\u2014like \u201cthis deal slipped because stage age is 2x benchmark and no next meeting is booked.\u201d It\u2019s meant to cut the end-of-quarter surprises.",

    {
      "text": "Miguel Dean: Okay, but forecasting has never been a software issue for us. It\u2019s more process and people.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: I hear that a lot. The reason I\u2019m calling Kinetic Harbor Renewables specifically is because when teams have process but still see variance, it\u2019s usually because the forecast is being built off stage alone. This adds the behavioral signals automatically, and it gives managers and reps the same set of explainable rules. It\u2019s less \u201cgut feel\u201d and more \u201chere\u2019s what\u2019s missing to make this deal real.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s exactly why we show the drivers and let you tune the benchmarks by segment\u2014like project type, deal size, source, or territory. It\u2019s not a black box. You can see forecast by segment, rep, and source, and it\u2019ll highlight conversion and slippage patterns unique to your motion.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Understood. Even with a small team, the opportunity cost is huge. One use case we see is: if you\u2019re already doing any kind of fit scoring\u2014like identifying your best target accounts\u2014Sales_Accelerator can pull that in and recommend the next 50 accounts to contact, with tailored openers and proof points by segment so reps aren\u2019t starting from scratch.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Got it. We\u2019re not a replacement CRM\u2014Sales_Accelerator is a layer on top of Salesforce. Typically the pitch is: if you can improve forecast accuracy and reduce slippage, it pays for itself pretty quickly. But if your mandate is \u201cno net-new,\u201d I don\u2019t want to force it.",

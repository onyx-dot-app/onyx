      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Isabel\u2014Mina Park here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I work with revenue teams that are already on Salesforce or HubSpot but want a practical layer on top that tells reps what to do next, deal by deal, so pipeline doesn\u2019t stall. Does that map to anything you\u2019re feeling at Novafathom Analytics right now?",

    {
      "text": "Isabel Patel: Hi Mina. Yes, it does. We\u2019re growing, and consistency is a struggle\u2014especially around follow-up after discovery and keeping deals moving without me constantly chasing updates.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s exactly the gap Sales_Accelerator is built for. It\u2019s a sales execution layer that sits on top of your CRM and turns what you already know about accounts into action: it recommends next steps per opportunity, nudges reps when something\u2019s at risk, and standardizes the behaviors that top performers do without forcing a rigid methodology. Quick question\u2014what does \u201cgood follow-up\u201d look like today after a discovery call?",

    {
      "text": "Isabel Patel: Ideally, a recap email goes out the same day with next steps, stakeholders, timelines\u2026 but in reality, it\u2019s uneven. Some AEs are great; others send something vague days later. And mutual plans are kind of ad hoc.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Makes sense. One area customers see immediate lift is our sales_followup_recommendations. After a discovery meeting, Sales_Accelerator detects that a meeting happened but there\u2019s no clear follow-up logged, and it prompts the AE with a recommended action: draft a recap email, propose specific next steps, and create a mutual action plan\u2014owners, due dates, and who needs to be involved. It also flags when you\u2019re single-threaded, so if only one contact is active, it suggests multi-threading and gives a sequence suggestion\u2014like a short cadence across email and LinkedIn over a few days\u2014to pull in the right stakeholders.",

    {
      "text": "Isabel Patel: That sounds helpful. How does it know what proof points or messaging to use? We\u2019ve been trying to standardize positioning, but we don\u2019t want reps making things up.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/8264660-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great constraint, and we designed for that. Sales_Accelerator doesn\u2019t ask reps to invent messaging; it pulls from your approved positioning blocks and fit insights\u2014especially if you\u2019re already using Customer_Analyzer. So when the AE is writing the recap, it can suggest two tailored proof points from that approved library based on the account\u2019s fit score and the pains you\u2019ve tagged. The end result is reps move faster, but it\u2019s still consistent and explainable\u2014no random \u201cAI copy\u201d that doesn\u2019t match how you sell.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Two things that help adoption: first, it lives where reps already work\u2014inside the CRM or via a lightweight extension\u2014so it\u2019s not \u201cyet another tab.\u201d Second, we make it a task queue that\u2019s hard to ignore but easy to act on: \u201cSend recap + next steps,\u201d \u201cAdd stakeholder,\u201d \u201cBuild mutual plan checklist,\u201d that kind of thing. It\u2019s less about dashboards and more about a daily workflow that saves them time. If I asked your AEs what eats the most time post-discovery, what would they say?",

    {
      "text": "Isabel Patel: Chasing internal info, figuring out who else to loop in on the customer side, and remembering to send something that feels customized without spending an hour on it.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That lines up well. In the follow-up recommendation, the system checks who\u2019s engaged so far and what\u2019s missing in the mutual plan. If there\u2019s no procurement or technical evaluator identified\u2014depending on your deal type\u2014it prompts that and suggests an outreach sequence to bring them in. And for customization, it\u2019s not writing a novel; it\u2019s drafting a crisp recap email with placeholders and recommended proof points so the rep can send it in minutes. The goal is fewer \u201cwe\u2019ll get back to you\u201d dead ends and fewer deals slipping because next steps weren\u2019t concrete.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: It helps both, but we can keep today focused on follow-up since that\u2019s your pain. The same signals that drive the rep\u2019s next action\u2014no follow-up after a meeting, mutual plan incomplete, single-threading, low recent activity\u2014also roll up as risk alerts for managers. So instead of \u201cupdate your CRM,\u201d leaders see \u201cThese five deals are at risk because there\u2019s no next meeting scheduled and only one stakeholder engaged.\u201d It\u2019s actionable, not just a red/yellow/green score.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. Typically the fastest path is: connect Salesforce, connect Customer_Analyzer so we can consume fit scores and positioning blocks, then define your stages and what \u201cdone\u201d looks like for a mutual action plan at each stage. From there, we pilot with a small AE group\u2014say 5\u201310 reps\u2014focused on one motion, like post-discovery follow-up for mid-market. You\u2019ll know quickly if it\u2019s improving follow-up speed and multi-threading rates.",

      "text": "Mina Park: For the use case you described, I\u2019d suggest a simple set: time-to-follow-up after discovery, percentage of opportunities with a documented mutual action plan within X days, stakeholder count per opp (to track multi-threading), and stage conversion from discovery to next stage. We can also look at stall rate\u2014how many opps go dark for, say, 14 days without activity. If those move in the right direction, it\u2019s usually a clear signal.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. What I\u2019d propose is a longer working session\u201430 to 45 minutes\u2014where I can show exactly what the follow-up recommendations look like inside Salesforce, including the recap email draft, the proof point insertion from your approved library, and how the mutual action plan checklist gets created with due dates. Then we can talk through a pilot plan and success metrics with your sales director and that manager. Does next week work?",

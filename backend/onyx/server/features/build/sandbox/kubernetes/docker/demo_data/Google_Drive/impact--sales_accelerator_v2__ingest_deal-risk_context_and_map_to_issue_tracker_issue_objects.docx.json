      "text": "This feature adds the initial plumbing to ingest deal-risk signals from Sales_Accelerator v2 and attach them to the correct Issue_Tracker issue objects (e.g., theme/root cause). By using stable identifiers\u2014account/customer plus related conversation references\u2014we create a repeatable mapping so that risk context lands on the right issue rather than being stranded as standalone sales data.\n\nOnce mapped, we\u2019ll persist a normalized set of deal-risk fields on each issue\u2019s context record (risk score, impacted deal IDs, stage, ARR, etc.). This makes deal-risk information queryable and durable, enabling consistent downstream use across prioritization, reporting, and future automation without re-fetching or re-deriving signals.\n\nThe immediate product impact is improved visibility: teams can see which issues are linked to active revenue risk, and how big/urgent that risk is, directly where engineering triage happens. While this release explicitly does not change prioritization logic, it lays the foundation for \u201cpriority boosting\u201d and more revenue-aware triage in subsequent iterations.\n\nTo protect data quality early, we\u2019ll include basic validation and logging when mappings are missing or ambiguous (e.g., multiple candidate issues for the same account + conversation). This reduces silent failures, gives us observability into coverage and mapping accuracy, and helps us iterate on identifier strategy before we make deal-risk a decision-making input.",

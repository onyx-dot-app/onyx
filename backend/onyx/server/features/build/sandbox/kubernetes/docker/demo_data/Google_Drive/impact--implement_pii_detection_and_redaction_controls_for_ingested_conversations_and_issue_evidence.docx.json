      "text": "This feature introduces workspace-level PII detection and redaction controls across all ingested customer support conversations and any derived artifacts (evidence snippets, issue notes). By automatically identifying common sensitive data (emails, phone numbers, addresses, access tokens, etc.), we reduce the likelihood of unintentionally storing or exposing regulated or confidential information in our product.\n\nRedaction will occur *before persistence* and *before any downstream sync* (e.g., Jira/Linear), ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the system unprotected. At the same time, we will preserve referential integrity back to the original source conversation where allowed, so teams can still trace issues to the correct thread without needing the raw PII in our database or external tools.\n\nAdministrators will be able to configure behavior per workspace via UI and API, including allow/deny lists to tailor what gets redacted and a preview flow to validate outcomes before enabling broadly. This reduces operational risk (misconfigured over-redaction) and supports different compliance postures across customers.\n\nFinally, an option to store only hashed identifiers enables matching and deduplication without retaining raw identifiers, improving safety while maintaining key product capabilities (e.g., linking repeat contacts or recurring issues). Overall, this feature materially strengthens trust and compliance readiness, lowers breach impact, and unblocks adoption in security-sensitive environments.",

      "text": "This feature adds an automatic \u201calignment check\u201d during the Sales_Accelerator \u2192 Customer_Analyzer v2 sync to ensure each synced account/opportunity is using the currently active/expected segment definition ID and messaging version. Today, outdated segment definitions or messaging can silently propagate, creating inconsistency between what teams believe is \u201capproved\u201d and what the system is actually using.\n\nOn each sync, the backend will compare the record\u2019s segment definition and messaging version against the active configuration. If either value is out of date, the system will mark the record with an `alignment_failed` status and emit a non-blocking warning entry in integration logs. Sync will continue (no hard failure), but the mismatch becomes visible and traceable for follow-up and remediation.\n\nThe primary impact is improved data integrity and operational control: teams can quickly identify which accounts/opportunities are misaligned before that misalignment impacts downstream analysis, reporting, or message drafting. It also reduces the support burden and time spent diagnosing \u201cwhy does this customer have old messaging/segmenting?\u201d by making misalignment explicit and persisted.\n\nThis ticket is intentionally scoped to detection + status recording only. It lays the foundation for subsequent work that will use the persisted status to drive UI gating and enforce \u201capproved messaging only\u201d draft behavior, without requiring another backend pass to identify misaligned records.",

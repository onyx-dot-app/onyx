      "text": "Sales Forecast stage aging is producing incorrect values when opportunities are imported from CRM/CSV because stage entry dates are inconsistently parsed (missing timezone/format normalization) and sometimes default to created_at. Update the import pipeline to reliably derive and store a canonical stage_entered_at per stage transition (or fall back deterministically when unavailable). This will unblock accurate stage aging calculations used downstream by rollups and conversion benchmarks.",

Ensure each event is validated and persisted with joinable keys (recommendation_instance_id, account/opportunity + CRM IDs, segment/rep/motion) so downstream attribution and aggregation are reliable. Add minimal observability (invalid-event counters, ingest latency, and drop/error logs) without blocking core recommendation workflows.",

      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Hi Terry\u2014good to see you again. Last time you mentioned your team is drowning in repeated customer issues across Zendesk and Intercom, and that it\u2019s hard to connect those themes back to Jira work and account impact in Salesforce. Today I wanted to show how Issue_Tracker specifically tackles that \u201csame issue, different words, different places\u201d problem and helps product leadership prioritize what to fix next.",

    {
      "text": "Terry Bennett: Hi Sneha. Yeah, that\u2019s still the pain. We\u2019ve got a lot of noise and not enough clarity. I\u2019m open to hearing it, but I\u2019m also wary of adding another layer that our support and product teams have to babysit.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair. The way Issue_Tracker is designed, it\u2019s not meant to replace Zendesk or Jira\u2014it sits between them. Two pieces I want to focus on for Echostone: first, the integrations/connectors so you can ingest from Zendesk/Intercom and sync to Jira/Linear with back-links; second, the way it ties issue clusters to customer/value context\u2014Salesforce or HubSpot plus your Customer_Analyzer fit tiers\u2014so the \u201cwhat matters most\u201d ranking isn\u2019t just volume-based.",

    {
      "text": "Terry Bennett: Okay. The connector story is the make-or-break for us. We\u2019ve been burned by \u201cintegrations\u201d that are basically a CSV export plus some brittle mapping.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Understood. The connectors are bi-directional where it matters. On ingest, we pull tickets and conversations from Zendesk/Intercom, and we keep the original links so anyone can click back to the source thread. On the delivery side, when a cluster is escalated into engineering work, we sync metadata into Jira\u2014like theme, impacted customers, and priority reason\u2014and we also keep the backlink from the Jira issue to the cluster so PMs don\u2019t lose the context.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: We support field mapping and rules\u2014so you can map your forms, tags, custom fields into a normalized issue object. And you can set dedupe rules, like \u201cif these fields match, treat as same theme,\u201d or \u201ckeep separate if product line differs.\u201d The goal is: no duplicate data entry, and your existing tools remain the systems of record.",

    {
      "text": "Terry Bennett: You said \u201cdedupe rules.\u201d That\u2019s where I start to get nervous. We tried clustering in another tool and it merged unrelated issues\u2014especially when enterprise customers describe problems in their own jargon. Support lost trust in it fast.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s a common failure mode. Issue_Tracker clusters based on multiple signals, not just keyword similarity, and you can tune it. Plus, there\u2019s a feedback loop: when your team splits or merges clusters, the model learns your patterns.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Terry Bennett: How much effort is \u201ctune it\u201d? Because my support ops team is two people. If they have to spend hours correcting merges, it defeats the purpose.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: The typical rollout we do is start narrow: one channel\u2014say Zendesk\u2014and one product area. For the first couple weeks we monitor clustering quality and set guardrails. Once it\u2019s stable, we expand. The time burden is usually front-loaded.",

      "text": "Terry Bennett: \u201cUsually\u201d is doing a lot of work there. Our data is messy. And we have segmentation nuances\u2014Tier-1 ICP accounts use different terms than SMB. I worry we\u2019ll either get false merges that hide real issues, or fragmented clusters that don\u2019t actually reduce noise.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s exactly why tying in Customer_Analyzer fit tiers helps. When the system sees the same underlying theme across segments, it can keep it grouped but still show you \u201chow it manifests\u201d by segment and channel. And on prioritization, Product leadership can weight the cluster by ICP tier\u2014so a cluster impacting Tier-1 accounts rises above a similar-volume cluster in low-fit segments.",

      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Fair. Let me ask: what would \u201cgood enough\u201d clustering look like for you? Like, 80% accurate without manual corrections? Or is it higher?",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Makes sense. One way we reduce risk is doing a short proof-of-value: ingest, say, 60 days of Zendesk tickets plus Intercom conversations for one product line, connect Salesforce for account tier, and then measure: cluster precision, merge/split rates, and the time it takes your team to validate. If it\u2019s not meeting the bar, you don\u2019t proceed.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally. We can keep it to account tier and basic firmographics, or even just Customer_Analyzer tiers, without opportunities.

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Day-to-day: support stops triaging the same issue ten different ways; PMs see a unified theme with evidence and impacted customers; engineering gets a single Jira link with context; leadership gets a ranked list grounded in ICP tier rather than whoever shouts loudest. The connector backbone is what keeps it from becoming another silo.",

    {
      "text": "Terry Bennett: I get the promise. I\u2019m just not convinced the clustering won\u2019t become the bottleneck. Especially with the language variation problem I mentioned. And we\u2019ve had tooling sprawl\u2014people resist adopting \u201cone more dashboard.\u201d",

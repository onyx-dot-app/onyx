Persist notes immutably and expose them via the issue history API with basic validation/sanitization so they can be searched and displayed consistently. Ensure notes can be linked to relevant lifecycle transitions (e.g., triaged, deprioritized, blocked) without duplicating ownership/SLA logic from existing tickets.",

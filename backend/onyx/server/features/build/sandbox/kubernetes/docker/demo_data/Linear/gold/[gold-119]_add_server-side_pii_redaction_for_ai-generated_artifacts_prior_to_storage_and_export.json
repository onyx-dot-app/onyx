Add a per-tenant configuration flag (default off) and ensure redaction is consistently applied across UI and API entrypoints without duplicating RBAC, audit logging, or retention logic. Record in metadata that redaction was applied (and which policy/version), but never store raw PII in audit/event payloads when redaction is enabled.",

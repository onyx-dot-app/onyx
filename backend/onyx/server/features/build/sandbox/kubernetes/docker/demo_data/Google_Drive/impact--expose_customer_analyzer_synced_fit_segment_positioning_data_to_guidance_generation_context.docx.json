      "text": "This feature exposes Customer_Analyzer\u2019s synced account intelligence\u2014fit score, segment, and approved positioning blocks\u2014directly to our guidance generation context for both initiation and follow-up flows. By adding a retrieval layer (service method/API with caching where needed), guidance can reliably reference the same normalized data that Customer_Analyzer maintains, without duplicating logic in the generator.\n\nProduct impact is higher quality and consistency of guidance: when fit/segment/positioning are available, the generator can ground its recommendations in the customer\u2019s latest analyzed profile, reducing generic outputs and mismatches between what Sales expects (from Customer_Analyzer) and what guidance suggests. This also sets a foundation for future prompt improvements, since the data will already be present and standardized in the generation context.\n\nOperationally, the work ensures correct CRM entity mapping (account vs. opportunity) and deterministic selection of the most recent synced version, which reduces confusion caused by stale or ambiguous records. Safe fallbacks when data is missing or outdated ensure guidance remains available and avoids failures, even if the integration hasn\u2019t synced or is partially populated.\n\nScope is intentionally limited to data access and wiring\u2014no prompt or content changes\u2014so we should expect minimal user-visible behavior change until subsequent work leverages these fields explicitly. Success is measured by reliable retrieval in both flows, correct ID mapping across CRM objects, stable \u201clatest version\u201d behavior, and no increase in guidance generation errors or latency due to caching/retrieval.",

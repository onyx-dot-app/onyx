We invalidate the cached eligibility payload and re-run the prompt computation.\n- **Refresh triggers**:\n  - Contact record updates (including CRM sync writes)\n  - Contact merges\n  - Role/persona field changes\n  - Opportunity stage transitions\n  These events now publish a prompt-refresh signal for the affected account/opportunity scope.\n- **UI de-duplication**: The follow-up prompt list is normalized by a stable `promptId` (and scoped key where applicable) before rendering to prevent duplicate cards when multiple refreshes occur close together.\n- **Race-safety**: Refresh requests are coalesced per account/opportunity and only the latest computation result is applied to state to avoid \u201cdisappear then reappear\u201d behavior.\n\n## Instrumentation\n- Added lightweight logs/metrics around:\n  - Prompt refresh trigger source (contact update/merge/persona change/stage change)\n  - Account/opportunity identifiers\n  - Prompt IDs produced by the service and ultimately rendered by the UI\nThis is intended to validate refresh + de-dupe behavior in production with minimal overhead.\n\n## User impact\n- Follow-up prompts update immediately after CRM/contact changes and opportunity stage changes.\n- Duplicate prompt cards should no longer appear; prompts should not remain stale or vanish due to cached eligibility results.\n\n## Notes\n- Changes are scoped to the follow-up prompt service + UI refresh path; no product surface/UX changes beyond correctness.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n",

      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\n## Summary\nThis PR prevents Sales_Accelerator from generating/sending messaging using any Customer_Analyzer positioning content that is not an approved/published version. It adds server-side enforcement, a structured error contract for missing/unpublished pinned versions, and UI updates to surface the pinned version and a clear \u201crequest Marketing to publish\u201d blocking state instead of silently swapping content.\n\n## Backend changes\n- Added server-side validation in the Sales_Accelerator messaging/recommendation generation flow to:\n  - Resolve the pinned positioning block version for the account/opportunity.\n  - Verify the resolved version exists and is in a `PUBLISHED/APPROVED` state.\n  - Reject drafts, unversioned payloads, and any non-published statuses.\n- Introduced a structured error response when generation cannot proceed:\n  - Error code (e.g. `POSITIONING_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE`).\n  - Human-readable reason (missing vs unpublished vs invalid status).\n  - `pinnedVersionId` + metadata for the last known pinned version (when available) as the only allowed fallback reference.\n- Ensured generation/send endpoints never \u201cauto-fallback\u201d to latest/different content on the server; the only permissible reference is the pinned published version.\n\n## Frontend changes\n- Updated the Sales_Accelerator messaging/recommendation UI to:\n  - Display the pinned positioning version identifier/label used for the current content.\n  - Render the new structured error as a blocking state (no generate/send) with an explicit reason.\n  - Show a clear call-to-action prompt to request Marketing publish a new positioning variant rather than silently switching content.\n\n## Behavior changes (user-facing)\n- If a pinned positioning version is missing or not published, users will be blocked from generating/sending messaging and will see the reason and the last known pinned version details.\n- Draft/unversioned positioning content will never be used in Sales_Accelerator.\n\n## Notes\n- This is a high-priority safety/consistency fix: enforcement is server-side to avoid client bypasses.\n- Existing successful flows remain unchanged when the pinned version is published.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

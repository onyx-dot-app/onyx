On approval, triggers an Issue refresh (or updates local cache/state) so the tag/priority reflects instantly.\n- Adds client-side loading/disabled states for action buttons and basic error handling (toast/banner) for failed mutations.\n- Keeps rejected items in a \u201chistory\u201d section/state to ensure auditability.\n\n### User impact\n- **Owners** can review and action queued tag/priority edits directly from the Issue page.\n- **Non-owners** see no behavioral change beyond their edits continuing to generate requests (handled by GOLD-172).\n\n### Testing\n- Verified rendering for: no requests, multiple pending requests, mixed approved/rejected history.\n- Verified approve updates Issue immediately; reject requires reason and persists in history.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n",

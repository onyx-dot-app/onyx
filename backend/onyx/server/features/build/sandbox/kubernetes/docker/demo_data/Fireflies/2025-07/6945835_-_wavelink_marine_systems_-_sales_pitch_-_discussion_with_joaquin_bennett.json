      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Joaquin\u2014Mina Park here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll be brief: I work with teams that are trying to tighten up who they\u2019re selling to and how they talk about the product, so sales and marketing aren\u2019t improvising segment by segment. Does that sound relevant at Wavelink Marine Systems right now?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: Hey Mina, yeah, we\u2019re definitely feeling some of that. We have a few different buyer types and the messaging gets inconsistent. What are you thinking?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5004632-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. The product is called Customer_Analyzer. It pulls together the customer signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and turns them into practical outputs your team can actually use. The one I wanted to focus on is our positioning recommendations: it generates segment-specific messaging and an objection-handling playbook tied to the strongest value drivers for your best-fit accounts.",

    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: When you say \u201cpositioning recommendations,\u201d is this like generic templates, or is it actually based on our data?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: It\u2019s grounded in your data and customer language. We identify the fit drivers\u2014what patterns correlate with successful, retained customers\u2014and then the system produces editable messaging blocks that map back to the evidence. So you\u2019re not just getting \u201chere\u2019s a value prop,\u201d you\u2019re getting \u201chere\u2019s why this value prop is the right one for this segment,\u201d plus proof points to collect and the top objections you\u2019ll hit with suggested responses.",

    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: Interesting. We\u2019ve got a constant problem where reps are handling objections differently. Some of them over-discount, some over-promise. How does your objection guide actually help with that?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5004632-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s exactly the sales enablement use case we see most often. Customer_Analyzer outputs an objection-handling playbook per prioritized segment\u2014so, for example, if one buyer segment is highly price-sensitive and another is more risk-focused, you\u2019ll get different framing. It also includes pricing/value framing notes so your team can defend value consistently\u2014without making every deal a one-off negotiation.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Typically we start by connecting what you already have: a CRM export or integration, and then one or two other sources like support tickets or onboarding surveys. You can also upload notes from interviews or call summaries. The goal is to get enough signal to generate an initial set of segments and messaging blocks quickly\u2014then your team edits and approves them. It\u2019s designed to be lightweight to start and more robust as you add data.",

      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: And the output\u2014where does it live? Is it in your tool only, or can we share it with sales easily?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: You can share it easily. The recommendations come as editable blocks\u2014think website hero copy, sales deck bullets, email openers, and the objection responses\u2014so enablement can drop them into whatever you use today. The important part is they\u2019re linked back to the drivers and evidence, so when a rep asks \u201cwhy are we saying this?\u201d you\u2019re not hand-waving.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5004632-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: That linkage sounds useful. We\u2019ve had internal debates where marketing says one thing and sales says another, and nobody can point to real customer language.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5004632-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. It gives you a common source of truth based on observed language and outcomes. One quick example: if support tickets show a segment repeatedly mentioning downtime or compliance, that becomes a driver, and the positioning leans into reliability and risk reduction\u2014with suggested proof points to go collect. It helps align marketing, sales, and product around what\u2019s actually winning.",

    {
      "text": "Joaquin Bennett: Makes sense. How do you decide \u201cbest-fit\u201d segments? We have customers we like, but sometimes they\u2019re not the biggest revenue.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5004632-14"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great question. We look at whatever \u201csuccess\u201d means for you\u2014renewal, expansion, product adoption, sales cycle length, support burden\u2014and we can weight those. The fit score helps you see which segments match the product\u2019s current strengths, not just which ones are large. Then the positioning recommendations focus on the segments you choose to prioritize.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Yes. The best next step is a 30\u201345 minute working call where we learn your current segments, top objections you hear, and what data sources you have. Then we can show what the segment-specific messaging blocks and objection guide would look like for Wavelink\u2014using a small sample or a sanitized export if needed.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Minimal. If you can come with: (1) the top 5 objections your reps hear, (2) a quick list of the customer segments you think exist today, and (3) where your customer signals live\u2014CRM, support system, onboarding survey tool\u2014that\u2019s enough. If you\u2019re comfortable sharing a simple export later, we can use it to generate a more tailored first pass.",

      "text": "James Choi: Hi Audrey\u2014James Choi here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll be quick: I\u2019m calling because a lot of teams end up guessing which customer segments to lean into next quarter, and it usually shows up later as higher support load or churn. I wanted to share how Customer_Analyzer helps make that decision more data-driven, especially when you\u2019re balancing retention and support burden.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Customer_Analyzer pulls together the customer signals you already have\u2014things like CRM fields, product usage, onboarding surveys, support tickets, even notes from interviews\u2014and turns them into a simple fit score by account and by segment. So instead of \u201cwe think mid-market is better,\u201d you can see \u201cmid-market scores 82 because adoption is fast and retention is strong, while SMB scores 54 because support burden is high and time-to-value is longer.\u201d",

      "text": "Audrey Pierce: Okay. We have data in a few places, but we\u2019ve never really unified it. When you say fit score\u2014what is it actually measuring?",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Great question. The fit score is essentially \u201chow well does this customer type match your product\u2019s current strengths right now.\u201d You can define the drivers\u2014industry, company size, technographics, problem severity, willingness to pay, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, churn risk signals. Then the system outputs a 0\u2013100 score plus a driver breakdown so you can see why it\u2019s high or low. It also compares segments side-by-side so your team can align quickly.",

      "text": "Audrey Pierce: That sounds useful, but we\u2019re Nightfall Beacon Entertainment\u2014we\u2019re pretty particular about segments. We\u2019re not a typical B2B SaaS. Does it still work if our segmentation is more\u2026 nuanced?",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally. The segmentation is flexible. Some teams do classic firmographics; others do \u201cuse case segments,\u201d or \u201cchannel segments,\u201d or \u201ccontent library size,\u201d or \u201clive events vs on-demand.\u201d The key is: as long as there are signals that correlate with outcomes\u2014retention, expansion, conversion, support load\u2014Customer_Analyzer can model it. We\u2019re not forcing you into a template; we\u2019re helping you test which segment definitions actually predict success.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: That is exactly the use case where we tend to see quick wins: prioritizing which industries to target next quarter using retention and support burden signals. Customer_Analyzer can weight both. For example, if an industry has high retention but also high support burden and slow time-to-value, the score might land in the middle\u2014and the driver breakdown would explicitly show \u201cretention strong, support burden high.\u201d Then you can decide: do we invest in product improvements to lower support, or do we shift targeting toward the segment that renews *and* is lower-touch?",

One thing teams like is the recommended ICP profile the system generates based on observed outcomes\u2014so it\u2019s not just reporting; it\u2019s suggesting: \u201cHere\u2019s what your best-fit customers have in common,\u201d grounded in retention and expansion patterns.",

      "text": "James Choi: Fair. We keep the first step lightweight. For a first pass, we typically start with three inputs: basic CRM account fields, whatever you have for retention/renewal outcomes, and support ticket metadata\u2014volume, categories, time-to-resolution. That alone usually lets us build an initial fit model for industry prioritization. If you also have product usage events, even better, but we don\u2019t need perfection on day one.",

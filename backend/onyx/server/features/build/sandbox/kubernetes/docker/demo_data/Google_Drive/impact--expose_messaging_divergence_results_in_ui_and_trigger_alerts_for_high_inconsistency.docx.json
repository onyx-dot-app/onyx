      "text": "This feature will expose the existing messaging consistency audit results directly inside Customer_Analyzer so teams can quickly see where our messaging diverges across segments and channels. The UI will provide a lightweight \u201cconsistency\u201d surface that summarizes results by segment/channel and supports a drill-in details view.\n\nIn the details view, users will be able to inspect the divergence score alongside the specific areas causing inconsistency\u2014missing or altered value propositions, differentiators, and proof points\u2014so the output is actionable rather than just diagnostic. This makes it easier for marketing, product, and enablement to align on what\u2019s inconsistent and what needs to be corrected.\n\nTo reduce time-to-detection, we will add threshold-based alerting that triggers when divergence exceeds a configurable limit. Alerts will be delivered via Slack/email and will deep-link recipients directly to the relevant segment/channel view in Customer_Analyzer to support fast triage and remediation.\n\nThe primary impact is organizational: preventing \u201cmessaging drift\u201d by making inconsistencies visible, measurable, and easy to act on, without modifying the underlying audit computation from GOLD-48. Success will be reflected in reduced divergence over time in high-priority segments/channels and fewer instances of teams operating from conflicting messaging artifacts.",

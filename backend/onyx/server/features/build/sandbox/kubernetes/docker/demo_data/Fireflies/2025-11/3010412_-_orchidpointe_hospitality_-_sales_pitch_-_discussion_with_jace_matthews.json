    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great. So the product is Customer_Analyzer. It pulls in the customer signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding notes, usage events, support tickets\u2014and it outputs two things: a fit score by account or segment, and practical positioning recommendations you can hand to marketing and sales. The reason I reached out is I saw Orchidpointe Hospitality is likely juggling which industries or property types to focus on next quarter, and it\u2019s easy to over-index on revenue while missing retention or support burden. Does that sound familiar?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/2680179-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Jace Matthews: Sort of. We definitely look at retention. Support burden too, but it\u2019s not super formal.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s exactly where we help. The fit_estimation piece computes a 0\u2013100 fit score for accounts and for segments\u2014say \u201cboutique hotels vs multi-property groups,\u201d or \u201cSMB vs mid-market\u201d\u2014and it breaks down why the score is high or low. So instead of a gut feel like \u201cthis segment seems good,\u201d you see drivers like: time-to-value, adoption patterns, churn risk signals, and support load, side by side with retention and expansion outcomes.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Fair question. BI typically tells you what happened; Customer_Analyzer is specifically built to connect those outcomes to a repeatable \u201cfit model\u201d your teams can actually use for go-to-market decisions. Two key differences: first, the driver breakdown\u2014what factors correlate to retention, expansion, lower support. Second, the segment comparison and recommended ICP profile it generates based on observed outcomes, so you can say, \u201cHere are the top 2 segments to prioritize next quarter,\u201d with evidence behind it.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally understand. I\u2019m not trying to force a tool into your stack. Let me make it concrete with one use case: prioritizing which industries to target next quarter using retention and support burden signals. If today you\u2019re debating, for example, \u201cDo we lean into resorts, business hotels, or extended-stay,\u201d we can ingest your retention and ticketing data and show which segment has the best combination of: high renewal likelihood, lower support burden, and faster adoption. That typically informs both marketing targeting and sales qualification.",

    {
      "text": "Jace Matthews: We don\u2019t really segment that way. And our data\u2019s messy. Support tickets aren\u2019t consistently tagged.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s common. We don\u2019t require perfect tagging to start; we can begin with what you do have\u2014firmographics, deal stage data, renewal outcomes\u2014and then progressively add support signals. Even basic things like ticket volume per account, time-to-resolution, or number of escalations can be used as \u201csupport burden\u201d proxies if tagging isn\u2019t reliable.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Makes sense. If priorities are locked, this might be more of a next-quarter planning tool. The other quick win is sales alignment: the fit score can sit alongside your CRM so reps know which accounts resemble your best customers and why. That reduces time spent on low-fit deals and can tighten your ICP.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: I hear you\u2014ICP conversations get political fast. The angle here is we anchor it in observed outcomes rather than opinions. The output isn\u2019t \u201chere\u2019s a persona slide\u201d; it\u2019s \u201chere\u2019s the segment that retains 20% better and generates 30% fewer tickets, and here are the drivers.\u201d That tends to reduce debate because the data does the arguing.",

If it helps, we could do a short working session where we map your current signals and see if we can produce a first-pass segment comparison. But if now\u2019s not the time, I don\u2019t want to push.",

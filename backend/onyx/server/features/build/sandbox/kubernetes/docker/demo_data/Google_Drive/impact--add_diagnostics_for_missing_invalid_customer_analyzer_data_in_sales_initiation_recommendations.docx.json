      "text": "This feature adds diagnostics to the Sales Initiation Recommendations experience so we can detect and surface when required Customer_Analyzer inputs are missing or invalid at render time (e.g., fit score, segment, positioning block). Today, when these inputs are absent, the system silently falls back, which can lead to unexpected recommendation ordering or template output without a clear explanation.\n\nFor SDRs and Sales Ops, we\u2019ll introduce a lightweight debug payload/tooltip (behind a feature flag) that indicates which Customer_Analyzer fields were successfully used versus which fallbacks were applied for a given account. This reduces time spent troubleshooting \u201cwhy did this show up?\u201d questions and increases trust in the recommendations by making the underlying data quality visible when needed.\n\nFor Engineering and Product, we\u2019ll instrument logging around missing/invalid inputs and add basic metrics on fallback rates. This gives us an ongoing signal of integration stability over time, helps us catch regressions or upstream data issues earlier, and provides a measurable way to validate improvements to the Customer_Analyzer pipeline.\n\nOverall, the impact is higher transparency and debuggability without changing the core recommendation logic for most users, since the diagnostic UI remains gated behind a feature flag. The metrics and logs will also enable clearer operational ownership between teams by pinpointing whether issues stem from data availability, validity, or downstream rendering behavior.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Natalie\u2014good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to get clearer on which customer segments are actually your best fit, especially for product planning. I wanted to use today to show how Customer_Analyzer turns your existing signals into a fit score and then into positioning recommendations you can actually use. Does that still line up with what you\u2019re prioritizing this quarter?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5485394-1"
    },
    {
      "text": "Natalie Collins: Yeah, that\u2019s still the idea. We\u2019re getting pressure to make roadmap bets based on something more solid than anecdotal feedback. But I\u2019m also wary of tooling that looks great in a demo and then falls apart once it hits our actual data.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5485394-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Why don\u2019t we anchor on one concrete workflow: using Customer_Analyzer to identify high-fit customers with unmet needs so you can prioritize roadmap themes. The two pieces we\u2019d focus on are the fit score\u2014who looks like your best segment right now\u2014and then the positioning recommendation feature, which turns that into segment-specific messaging and objections. Would it help if I walked through what the output looks like and what inputs it needs from you?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5485394-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Natalie Collins: Sure. But inputs is where I\u2019m concerned. Our CRM fields are\u2026 not clean. Tagging is inconsistent. Usage data is split across tools. If your scoring depends on that, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get anything trustworthy.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5485394-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s one of the most common starting points. Customer_Analyzer can ingest what you have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys if you\u2019ve got them, product usage events, support tickets, even interview notes. The fit score is only as good as the signals, but the system also shows which drivers are being used and what evidence supports them, so you can see \u201cthis score is high because X, Y, Z.\u201d For product planning, we usually start with a smaller set of signals that are more reliable\u2014like plan type, industry, team size, and a couple of usage events\u2014then expand.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5485394-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Natalie Collins: The transparency part is good. But if half our accounts are missing team size and industry, we\u2019re going to bias the results. Also, our usage event taxonomy changed mid-year, so even that\u2019s messy.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5485394-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. On the event taxonomy change\u2014Customer_Analyzer can map events into a normalized set, but it does require some upfront definition. On missing CRM fields, you can still run scoring with partial data, but you\u2019re right: it can reduce accuracy. The reason I\u2019m still optimistic is that the positioning recommendation feature can pull language and themes from support tickets and interview notes, which are often richer than CRM fields. So even if scoring is imperfect early, you can still extract \u201cwhat do high-retention customers say they value\u201d and package that into segment messaging.",

    {
      "text": "Natalie Collins: That sounds nice, but we don\u2019t have interview notes in a central place. Support tickets exist, yes, but they\u2019re also inconsistent. And honestly, we don\u2019t want a tool telling us what our messaging is\u2014our marketing team is pretty particular.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: For sure\u2014this isn\u2019t meant to replace your team\u2019s judgment. Think of positioning recommendations as a draft that\u2019s anchored in evidence and editable. The outputs come as messaging blocks\u2014website hero copy options, sales deck bullets, email openers\u2014tied back to fit drivers and the customer language it\u2019s drawing from. Marketing can accept, edit, or reject, but it speeds up the iteration cycle and keeps sales and product aligned on what\u2019s resonating.",

And it also produces an objection-handling playbook\u2014like \u201cif this segment worries about implementation time, here\u2019s the evidence to collect and the framing that has worked.\u201d",

      "text": "Mina Park: Makes sense. Can I ask: if you had to pick one near-term win, would it be (a) improving how you prioritize segments for roadmap decisions, or (b) tightening sales and marketing messaging for a segment you already know is attractive?",

      "text": "Mina Park: If roadmap is the priority, we can keep scope tight. For example: define 2\u20133 candidate segments you\u2019re already debating, pull whatever consistent signals exist for those accounts, and run a fit analysis just within that cohort. Then the positioning recommendations can summarize the top use cases and differentiators for each segment, and\u2014importantly\u2014highlight what proof points you\u2019d need to collect to validate the bet. It can even call out where evidence is thin.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally. The implementation usually isn\u2019t \u201cclean everything.\u201d It\u2019s more: pick the minimum viable set of fields and signals, map them, and start. Typically a couple CRM fields, one or two product events, and one text source like tickets. If we did a pilot, we\u2019d timebox it to, say, a few weeks and measure whether the outputs are actionable for product planning.",

      "text": "Natalie Collins: A pilot sounds fine in theory, but we\u2019ve been burned. Vendors say \u201cfew weeks\u201d and then it\u2019s a slow integration slog. Plus, security review alone can take us a month.",

If security and integration lead times are a blocker, one option is to start with a lightweight dataset export\u2014CSV from CRM plus a support ticket export\u2014no live integration at first. That can produce an initial fit score and positioning recommendations to prove value before you invest in deeper connections.",

Our CRM exports miss fields because reps don\u2019t fill them in, and support tickets often don\u2019t map cleanly to customer accounts. I\u2019m worried we\u2019ll spend time and end up with a fancy output that we can\u2019t trust enough to bet the roadmap on.",

    {
      "text": "Natalie Collins: Correlation with retention would be the big one. If you can show that the \u201chigh fit\u201d group is actually the group that renews or expands, then we\u2019re talking.

      "text": "Natalie Collins: Exactly. Marketing might like the messaging blocks, but I\u2019m not buying a platform primarily for that. And product planning is where we need rigor, not just plausible-sounding insights.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That makes sense. If we can\u2019t get to outcome correlation, another path is to use Customer_Analyzer to identify \u201cunmet needs\u201d by clustering themes in tickets and surveys\u2014more qualitative, less scoring-dependent\u2014and then treat the fit score as directional only.

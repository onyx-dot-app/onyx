      "text": "This feature adds an onboarding/setup step that automatically derives baseline sales benchmarks from a customer\u2019s own CRM opportunity history (last 6\u201312 months). Instead of asking admins to manually define assumptions in spreadsheets, the product will propose defaults such as average time in stage, stage-to-stage conversion rates, win rate, and typical deal size (including segmentation where the CRM data supports it). The intent is to make \u201cday one\u201d configuration faster while ensuring benchmarks reflect actual historical performance.\n\nThe primary user impact is on revenue operations and sales operations admins responsible for initial setup and ongoing calibration. They\u2019ll see recommended benchmark values alongside clear data coverage indicators\u2014time window analyzed and sample size\u2014so they can quickly judge reliability, accept as-is, or edit specific numbers. This reduces setup friction, improves confidence in the model, and creates a repeatable starting point across teams and accounts.\n\nDownstream, the chosen benchmarks become a durable configuration layer used to calibrate forecasting and power \u201cdeal at risk\u201d alerts. Because benchmarks are grounded in observed CRM behavior, forecasts should start closer to reality and risk flags should be better aligned with what \u201cnormal\u201d progression looks like for that org (and segment, when available). This also creates a consistent baseline for measuring improvement over time.\n\nKey considerations include handling sparse or skewed datasets (e.g., low opportunity volume, seasonality, major process changes) and making those limitations explicit via coverage indicators. The UI should clearly distinguish system-recommended values from admin edits, and persistence should be reliable so subsequent forecasting and alerts are stable. Overall, this feature shifts setup from manual configuration to guided, data-driven defaults while preserving admin control.",

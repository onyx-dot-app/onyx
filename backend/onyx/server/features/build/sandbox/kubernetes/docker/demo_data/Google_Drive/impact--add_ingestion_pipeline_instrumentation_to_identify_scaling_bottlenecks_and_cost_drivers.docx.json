      "text": "This feature adds end-to-end observability to our ingestion pipeline\u2014from fetch \u2192 parse \u2192 dedupe/cluster \u2192 persist \u2192 downstream sync\u2014so we can reliably identify where scaling bottlenecks and cost drivers emerge as volume grows. Today, performance issues and cost spikes are hard to attribute to a specific stage or workload pattern; this instrumentation makes the pipeline measurable and debuggable with clear stage-level accountability.\n\nWe will implement standardized metrics and tracing across each stage, capturing latency, throughput, queue depth, and error rates, plus per-stage compute and database cost estimates. This turns \u201cthe pipeline is slow/expensive\u201d into concrete answers like \u201cdedupe CPU time spiked for a subset of sources\u201d or \u201cpersist is saturating DB I/O and causing queue growth,\u201d enabling targeted optimization rather than broad resource increases.\n\nTo make root-cause analysis practical, we\u2019ll add structured logs with correlation IDs per source conversation/ticket so we can trace a single work item through all stages and quickly pinpoint slow or expensive paths. This is particularly important for debugging long-tail outliers, retries, and data-specific edge cases that are often invisible in aggregate metrics.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll ship a basic dashboard and alerts to surface regressions early\u2014e.g., rising queue depth, increasing p95 latency, or elevated error rates\u2014as backlog and work-item volume increases. The expected impact is faster incident triage, fewer performance regressions reaching customers, more predictable scaling decisions, and materially improved cost efficiency by focusing optimization on the true drivers.",

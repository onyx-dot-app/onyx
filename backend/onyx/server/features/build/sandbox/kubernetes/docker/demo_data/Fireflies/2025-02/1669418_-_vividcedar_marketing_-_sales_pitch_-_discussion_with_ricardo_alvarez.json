      "text": "Mina Park: I\u2019m reaching out because we built a product called Customer_Analyzer. It pulls together the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and turns that into a simple, defensible \u201cwho should we go after next\u201d answer. I noticed Vividcedar Marketing has been expanding campaigns across a few verticals, and I\u2019m guessing prioritization is getting harder.",

The core output we focus on is a fit score\u20140 to 100\u2014at the account and segment level. Then we show the driver breakdown, so it\u2019s not a black box: \u201cHere\u2019s why mid-market healthcare scores higher than SMB retail,\u201d for example, based on retention, support burden, time-to-value, and adoption patterns.",

      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s the normal starting point. Customer_Analyzer ingests from your CRM and support system first\u2014because those are fast wins\u2014then you can layer in product usage events if you have them, and any structured survey data. The key is you define the fit drivers you care about\u2014industry, size, problem severity, support burden, churn risk\u2014and we compute the score per segment, plus a segment comparison view.",

One common workflow is: \u201cPrioritize which industries to target next quarter using retention and support burden signals.\u201d So instead of deciding based on pipeline alone, you can answer: which industries convert well *and* renew well *and* don\u2019t overload support.

If the score says \u201c72,\u201d we show the \u201cwhy\u201d: strong adoption patterns, low support burden, fast time-to-value, and low churn risk signals. Or the opposite: good conversion, but poor retention and high support cost. That way the conversation changes from opinions to trade-offs.",

Customer_Analyzer will compare those segments side-by-side. Then, based on outcomes, it can recommend a tighter ICP definition\u2014for example, \u201cmid-market manufacturing with high onboarding survey severity and fast activation,\u201d if that\u2019s what correlates with retention and expansion.",

If you have any proxy for adoption\u2014logins, activation milestones, feature usage\u2014it helps, but you can get a lot from CRM + support + retention outcomes alone.

You can bring whoever owns planning\u2014maybe someone from ops or product marketing\u2014and we\u2019ll map your fit drivers, then I\u2019ll show you what the output looks like: the fit score per segment, the breakdown, and what an ICP recommendation would look like for Vividcedar.",

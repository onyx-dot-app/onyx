Webhook payload should include asset_id, external_id, asset_version, approved_at/updated_at, and a minimal summary so downstream tools can trigger a targeted re-sync via the existing export endpoints. Include webhook signing (shared secret) and delivery retries with dead-letter logging for failed destinations.",

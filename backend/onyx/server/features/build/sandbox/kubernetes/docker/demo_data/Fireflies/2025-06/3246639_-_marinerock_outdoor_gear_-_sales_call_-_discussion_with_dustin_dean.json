    {
      "text": "Dustin Dean: Hey James\u2014yeah, definitely. We\u2019re still doing a lot of manual stitching together from Salesforce, and it gets messy fast. The hardest part is figuring out which \u201ccommit\u201d deals are actually solid.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s exactly where Sales_Accelerator is strongest. Since you already have Salesforce as the source of truth, we sit on top of it\u2014no rip-and-replace\u2014and we generate an explainable forecast at the opportunity and pipeline level. The big shift is it doesn\u2019t just look at stage; it blends in activity signals like last touch, meetings scheduled, and how long the deal\u2019s been sitting in-stage, and then shows you the drivers behind the number.",

    {
      "text": "Dustin Dean: When you say \u201cexplainable,\u201d what does that look like? Because I\u2019ve seen forecasting tools that give you a score and everyone immediately distrusts it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3591754-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally fair. In Sales_Accelerator, every forecast view\u2014commit, best case, pipeline\u2014can be drilled into so a manager can answer \u201cwhy is this deal weakening?\u201d You\u2019d see, for example: stage age is above your benchmark, there\u2019s no next meeting on the calendar, email activity dropped in the last two weeks, and for deals like this historically your win rate is X. It\u2019s not a black box score; it\u2019s a set of visible drivers you can act on in a deal review.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3591754-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Dustin Dean: Okay, that\u2019s interesting. We do have a problem where reps keep deals in commit because they \u201cfeel good,\u201d and then two weeks later we realize there\u2019s no next step.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3591754-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly. So one common workflow for a VP Sales is: on Monday, you pull your commit forecast, then filter for \u201ccommit deals showing risk signals.\u201d Risk signals are things like stage aging beyond your norm, no next meeting scheduled, low engagement, or slipping close dates. Instead of debating every deal, you run targeted deal reviews on the few that are statistically weakening.",

    {
      "text": "Dustin Dean: That would save time. But how does it handle differences across segments? Our wholesale deals behave differently than our direct-to-consumer partnerships.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Great point. Forecasting can be sliced by segment, rep, and source. And the benchmarks\u2014like typical cycle time and stage conversion\u2014can be learned separately per segment. So wholesale doesn\u2019t get judged by the same \u201cnormal\u201d as a smaller partnership motion. That\u2019s also where the \u201cdrivers\u201d stay credible because it\u2019s comparing like-to-like historical patterns.",

      "text": "Dustin Dean: Makes sense. We also talked last time about our ICP work. We\u2019ve been using Customer_Analyzer for fit scoring\u2014how does your product relate to that?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3591754-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Perfect segue. Sales_Accelerator integrates with Customer_Analyzer rather than duplicating it. If you have fit tiers or fit scores coming out of Customer_Analyzer, Sales_Accelerator can use that as a weighting factor in forecast and prioritization. So if two deals look identical in stage and activity but one is ICP Tier 1 and the other is Tier 3, you\u2019ll see that reflected in both forecast confidence and where managers focus attention.",

    {
      "text": "Dustin Dean: I like the idea, but I worry reps will push back if they feel like the tool is \u201coverruling\u201d their judgment. Especially if it starts telling them their commit deal isn\u2019t commit.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s a healthy concern, and we see it a lot early on. The way teams get adoption is by positioning it as \u201cbetter deal inspection,\u201d not \u201cthe tool is the boss.\u201d In practice, you use it to ask better questions: \u201cI see we\u2019re in commit but there\u2019s no next meeting\u2014what\u2019s the agreed next step?\u201d Or \u201cWe\u2019re past the normal stage time\u2014what\u2019s changed?\u201d The rep can absolutely override, but the tool forces the conversation onto facts\u2014stage age, engagement, next meeting\u2014so it\u2019s constructive rather than personal.",

      "text": "James Choi: Exactly, and that\u2019s where the quarter-end scramble comes from. Another angle: scenario planning. So you can do \u201cwhat if\u201d planning\u2014like, \u201cIf we add 20 SQLs in our ICP Tier 1 segment, what\u2019s the expected impact on pipeline coverage or bookings this quarter?\u201d It\u2019s not just a static forecast; it helps you pressure-test assumptions and see what levers actually move the number.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: You\u2019re right to anchor on that. We typically start with a short baseline phase: connect Salesforce, pull historical opps, and generate stage conversion and cycle-time benchmarks. Then we compare Sales_Accelerator\u2019s forecast against your last few quarters and current pipeline to calibrate. If you have gaps\u2014like missing activity logging or inconsistent stage definitions\u2014we\u2019ll surface that fast because the drivers will look off. The goal is to make the quality issues visible, not hide them.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: It doesn\u2019t require perfection, but it does get stronger with consistency. If activity is sparse, the model leans more on stage age, close date movement, and historical outcomes for similar deals\u2014and it will show that in the drivers. And practically, a lot of teams use this as a gentle nudge: when reps see that \u201cno next meeting\u201d is making their deals show up as risk, they start scheduling and logging the next step because it directly impacts how leadership views the deal.",

      "text": "James Choi: For Marinerock, I\u2019d recommend we start with the VP Sales quarter-end accuracy use case: replace the spreadsheet rollups with the explainable forecast and a \u201ccommit risk\u201d view for deal reviews. It\u2019s a clean before/after: time saved, fewer surprises, and better visibility into which commit deals are weakening and why. Once that\u2019s working, you can expand into deeper guidance, but forecasting is the fastest path to measurable ROI.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Lightweight to start. Since we sit on Salesforce, we\u2019re not changing your process; we\u2019re reading it and layering analytics and guidance. Typically: week one is integration and data mapping, week two is calibration and validation with your sales ops lead, and then we do a manager enablement session focused on using the drivers in deal reviews. You can be live for a pilot inside a month, often sooner depending on access and data hygiene.",

      "text": "James Choi: We make it workflow-based. For the pilot, we pick one segment or one leadership cadence\u2014like your weekly commit call. Success criteria could be: eliminate the manual rollup, use Sales_Accelerator forecast as the default view, and require that every commit deal has an identified next step. We\u2019ll track how many \u201ccommit risk\u201d deals get addressed and whether slippage decreases. If it\u2019s not being used in the meeting rhythm, it won\u2019t stick\u2014so we design it around that rhythm.",

If they\u2019re aligned, we can move to a formal proposal right after. Does that work?",

      "text": "This feature adds a new backend API endpoint in the Sales_Accelerator service that, given an account or opportunity ID, returns the canonical Customer_Analyzer positioning block. Alongside the block content, the endpoint will include a stable identifier/version and a last-updated timestamp so downstream clients can reason about \u201cwhich exact version\u201d of the positioning is being referenced.\n\nThe primary product impact is enabling reliable staleness detection during editing and review flows. Instead of comparing against manually pasted text (which can drift, be partially edited, or lose provenance), Sales_Accelerator will be able to compare the user\u2019s current block to the latest canonical version and clearly signal whether the content is up to date.\n\nThis also unlocks a safe, deterministic \u201cReplace with latest from Customer_Analyzer\u201d action. When a user chooses to refresh, the client can fetch and insert the canonical block with confidence, while maintaining metadata that supports subsequent comparisons, auditing, and reducing ambiguity about what source content was used.\n\nOperationally, the endpoint will include robust error handling for missing or unauthorized Customer_Analyzer data, allowing the UI to provide clear fallbacks instead of failing silently. Brief caching will reduce repeated calls to Customer_Analyzer during edit flows, improving responsiveness and lowering backend load while preserving correctness for near-real-time updates.",

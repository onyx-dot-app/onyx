      "text": "This change hardens the fit scoring service by adding strict schema validation at the scoring boundary so that missing values, NaNs, out-of-range numbers, and unexpected enum values are no longer silently coerced into defaults. Today, these invalid inputs can skew overall fit scores and distort driver breakdowns, creating a false sense of confidence even when the upstream CSV import is \u201cnormalized.\u201d With stricter validation, fit scores will better reflect the true underlying customer data quality and improve trust in the outputs.\n\nFrom a product perspective, the primary impact is improved score integrity and explainability. Instead of producing misleading results, the service will explicitly identify which fields are invalid and ensure those invalid fields are excluded from scoring calculations. This reduces noisy score changes caused by accidental data issues, makes driver breakdowns more reliable, and helps downstream consumers (UI, reporting, and integrations) reason about why a score looks the way it does.\n\nThe caller will receive a clear, actionable error payload that includes per-field validation errors at the record level, while still allowing scoring to proceed for otherwise-valid customers. This \u201cpartial success\u201d behavior prevents one bad record or field from blocking an entire batch, and enables workflows where teams can remediate specific issues (e.g., fix a bad enum mapping or out-of-range value) without losing visibility into valid results.\n\nOperationally, this will change the contract from \u201cbest-effort coercion\u201d to \u201cvalidated inputs with explicit errors,\u201d which may surface new warnings/errors for existing clients that unknowingly relied on coercion. The impact should be manageable: valid records continue to score as before, invalid fields are ignored rather than mis-scored, and the returned validation feedback provides a clear path to correction and improved data quality over time.",

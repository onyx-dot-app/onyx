The panel should load the correct record context (CRM object + ID), handle auth/session handoff, and display a basic container state (loading/empty/error) ready for guidance content blocks. This ticket is focused on the embedded container + context wiring; guidance block rendering and copy actions are handled in subsequent tickets.",

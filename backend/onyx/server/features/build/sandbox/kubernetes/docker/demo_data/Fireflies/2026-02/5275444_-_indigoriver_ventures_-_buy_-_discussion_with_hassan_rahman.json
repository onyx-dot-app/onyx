      "text": "Camila Vega: Hassan, good to see you again. Thanks for making time for call three. My goal today is pretty simple: confirm we\u2019re aligned on the outcomes you want from Sales_Accelerator, address the one open concern you raised on trust/explainability, and\u2014if everything checks out\u2014lock in next steps to get you live this quarter. Sound fair?",

    {
      "text": "Hassan Rahman: Yep, that works. We\u2019re interested, we just need to be confident it won\u2019t become another \u201cblack box\u201d telling reps what to do without context.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally. Before we hit explainability, quick recap of what you told me last time so I don\u2019t misframe it: you want fewer deals slipping late in the quarter, a clearer view of what\u2019s real in the forecast, and you want AEs to run tighter follow-up after discovery\u2014without adding more admin on top of Salesforce. Is that still the priority?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6514618-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Hassan Rahman: Exactly. And adoption is huge. If reps don\u2019t trust the recommendations, nothing matters.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great. Let\u2019s focus on two pieces that map directly: Warning Alerts to prevent slippage, and the AE follow-up recommendations after discovery that create a consistent cadence\u2014recap email, proof points, and a mutual action plan. I\u2019ll also show you how we make both explainable so reps aren\u2019t guessing \u201cwhy.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Picture a commit deal in Salesforce that\u2019s been quiet for ten days, no meeting on the calendar, and it\u2019s single-threaded\u2014only one champion. Sales_Accelerator triggers a warning alert: \u201cInactivity + no upcoming meeting + champion risk.\u201d It routes to your AE in Slack or email\u2014your choice\u2014and optionally logs in the CRM. Along with the alert, it recommends a remediation play like \u201cschedule exec alignment,\u201d \u201creconfirm timeline,\u201d or \u201cintroduce security/legal early\u201d depending on what signals are present.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Two ways. First, alerts are tied to benchmarks and thresholds you control\u2014stage aging beyond your norm, inactivity windows by stage, what counts as \u201csingle-threaded,\u201d and which stages you want monitored. Second, we prioritize by impact: you\u2019ll see \u201chigh-fit but at-risk\u201d deals at the top when we\u2019re consuming Customer_Analyzer fit scores\u2014so managers aren\u2019t chasing low-probability deals just because they\u2019re loud.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. We don\u2019t duplicate it. Sales_Accelerator pulls the fit score and the approved positioning blocks. That\u2019s how we can say, \u201cThis is high-fit, but it\u2019s slipping because there\u2019s no next meeting and it\u2019s aging in stage.\u201d It\u2019s a prioritization layer and an execution layer on top of Salesforce, not another place to redo ICP or messaging.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Every alert and recommendation has drivers. So instead of \u201cDeal at risk,\u201d it shows the contributing factors\u2014like \u201clast touch 12 days ago,\u201d \u201cstage age 28 days vs benchmark 14,\u201d \u201cno future meeting found,\u201d \u201conly 1 stakeholder logged,\u201d or \u201cpricing/terms risk flagged from notes.\u201d Reps can click into the driver list, see the evidence, and take the suggested action or dismiss it with a reason. That dismissal feedback is visible to managers too, so it becomes a coaching moment rather than a fight with a bot.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: It works with what you already have, and it improves as hygiene improves. Core signals come from CRM fields\u2014stage, last activity, meetings, contacts/roles\u2014and from notes where available. But we\u2019re not requiring \u201cperfect\u201d to start. For a first rollout, teams usually begin with the highest-confidence alerts: inactivity, stage aging, no upcoming meeting, and single-threading. Those are very objective and immediately actionable.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: This is the other feature I\u2019d anchor on. After discovery, Sales_Accelerator can draft a recap email\u2014pulled from your approved template style\u2014then it suggests two tailored proof points from the positioning library you already maintain in Customer_Analyzer. And it generates a mutual action plan: due dates, stakeholders, and next meetings, based on the deal\u2019s stage and what\u2019s missing\u2014like \u201csecurity review scheduled,\u201d \u201ceconomic buyer identified,\u201d \u201csuccess criteria confirmed.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: We meet them where they are. The recap and action plan can be created from within the CRM context, and the reminders can route via Slack. The point is: we\u2019re not asking them to switch systems; we\u2019re adding a consistent \u201cbest next action\u201d workflow on top of the CRM so follow-up happens the same way across the team.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Two anchors prevent generic output. One is Customer_Analyzer positioning blocks\u2014approved proof points and messaging that you trust. The other is deal context: what was captured in discovery, what stage you\u2019re in, and what\u2019s missing for progression. So the tool isn\u2019t inventing a random pitch; it\u2019s selecting from your library and highlighting gaps like \u201cno timeline confirmed\u201d or \u201cno multi-threading\u201d and translating that into a concrete next step.",

Week one: connect Salesforce and Customer_Analyzer, define alert thresholds and routing. Week two: turn on the four core alerts plus the discovery follow-up workflow. Weeks three and four: measure outcomes\u2014reduced stage aging, increased meeting set rate post-discovery, and manager time saved in deal inspection. We\u2019ll review weekly so you can see whether the drivers are matching reality.",

If you\u2019re comfortable, I\u2019d like to propose we move forward today with the pilot order form and target kickoff next Monday.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Yes on both. Explainability is not an add-on\u2014it\u2019s core. And alert tuning is part of the initial configuration; we typically adjust thresholds in the first two weeks based on what your manager sees in pipeline reviews. Also, we\u2019ll set routing so it\u2019s helpful: reps get the alert plus \u201cwhy,\u201d managers get a roll-up of \u201chigh-fit but at-risk\u201d deals.",

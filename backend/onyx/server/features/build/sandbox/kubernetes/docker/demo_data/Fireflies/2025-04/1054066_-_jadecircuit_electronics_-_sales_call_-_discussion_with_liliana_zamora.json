      "text": "James Choi: Hi Liliana\u2014good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to prioritize which industries to target next quarter, but retention and support burden are pulling you in different directions. Does that still capture the main goal for today?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-1"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Hi James, yes. We have a few industries that look promising on pipeline, but some of them are a headache for support. Leadership wants a recommendation we can stand behind.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Perfect. The way Customer_Analyzer helps here is we turn those signals\u2014retention, expansion, support tickets, even usage\u2014into a clear segment view, and then we generate positioning recommendations so your team can actually act on it. For today, I\u2019d like to focus on two things: how the positioning recommendation feature works, and how you\u2019d use it to pick industries for next quarter. Sound good?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in. I\u2019m especially curious how it turns that into something marketing and sales can use.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Great. So once we ingest the signals, we identify the segments that are performing well\u2014say \u201cmid-market industrial OEMs\u201d versus \u201csmall contract manufacturers,\u201d whatever your taxonomy is. Then positioning_recommendation outputs editable messaging blocks tied to the fit drivers and evidence. For example: a segment-specific value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, proof points to collect, and an objection-handling playbook. It\u2019s not just \u201chere\u2019s a persona\u201d\u2014it\u2019s \u201chere\u2019s what to say, backed by why.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Okay. When you say \u201cbacked by why,\u201d what does that look like? We\u2019ve had tools spit out generic messaging that doesn\u2019t match reality.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally fair. In Customer_Analyzer, every recommended message links back to the drivers and signals that produced it. So if the value prop says, \u201cReduce downtime through faster part traceability,\u201d you can click into the underlying evidence\u2014like higher retention among accounts using traceability features weekly, or support tickets showing that segments who care about compliance are more satisfied when onboarding includes specific workflows. The idea is your team can sanity-check it, and edit it with confidence.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: That\u2019s helpful. One concern I have is our data quality. Our CRM fields are incomplete, and our support tickets aren\u2019t consistently tagged. Won\u2019t that mess up the outputs?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: It can, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re raising it now. Data quality and missing fields do reduce scoring accuracy if we treat everything as equally reliable. What we typically do in week one is a data audit: we map what fields you have, assess coverage, and then pick a \u201cminimum viable\u201d set of signals that are consistently available\u2014often retention, plan tier, industry, and a couple of usage events. We can still generate strong positioning recommendations from a smaller, clean set, and then improve fidelity as you standardize tagging over time.",

    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: So you\u2019re not saying we need to fix our whole CRM before we can use this.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly. We don\u2019t want that to become a blocker. For your use case\u2014prioritizing industries next quarter\u2014we can start with retention and support burden, plus whatever usage events you trust most. Then the recommendations will explicitly show confidence levels and what evidence is missing. That way, if an industry looks attractive but the support burden data is messy, it\u2019s visible rather than hidden.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: I like the transparency angle. Another question: our marketing team needs actual copy\u2014website hero statements, email openers, sales deck bullets. Does the product really give those, or is it more like guidance?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: It provides the actual blocks, and they\u2019re editable. For a prioritized segment, you\u2019d see something like: website hero copy options, \u201cthree bullets for a sales deck,\u201d a short outbound email opener, and then the proof points to collect\u2014like \u201ccapture a case study emphasizing reduced rework\u201d or \u201cquantify support response time improvements.\u201d And importantly, it\u2019s consistent across channels so sales and marketing aren\u2019t telling different stories.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-13"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: That alignment is a big deal for us. Sales tends to improvise based on what they think will land.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly\u2014and that\u2019s where you see longer cycles and more churn. If you pick an industry to target, Customer_Analyzer helps ensure the narrative matches what your best customers actually value, and arms sales with an objection-handling playbook. For example, if one industry consistently pushes back on implementation effort, the playbook would recommend the best counterpoints and what proof to cite.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-15"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Okay, but how do you decide which industries are \u201cbest\u201d? We have some customers who renew but are unprofitable because support is intense.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1969745-16"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Great nuance. We don\u2019t just look at retention in isolation. For industry prioritization, we can include support burden as a negative signal\u2014ticket volume, severity, time-to-resolution. So an industry with decent retention but very high support cost can score lower than an industry with slightly lower retention but clean support patterns and stronger product usage depth. The output you get is a clear ranking with the drivers spelled out.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly the pain we\u2019re trying to remove. Let me make this concrete. Suppose next quarter you\u2019re choosing between Industry A and Industry B. Customer_Analyzer would show: \u201cIndustry A retains 12% better but generates 2.3x tickets; Industry B retains slightly less but has higher feature adoption tied to expansion.\u201d Then the positioning recommendation for the chosen industry would say, \u201cLead with X use case, differentiate on Y, collect Z proof.\u201d It\u2019s a decision plus an execution kit.",

      "text": "Liliana Zamora: That\u2019s the part I\u2019m trying to get to\u2014less debate, more action. What would you need from us to get a first pass of that?",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: For a fast start, we\u2019d want: your current customer list with industry, retention/cohort data if you have it, and a support export\u2014even if tags are imperfect. Then 2\u20133 key product usage events you trust. We can ingest that and deliver an initial industry prioritization plus positioning blocks within about two weeks. And we\u2019d do a review session with you where you tell us what\u2019s off, what resonates, and we tune from there.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s common. We can normalize industries during onboarding\u2014mapping variants to a standard taxonomy. We can also start with broader buckets if needed and refine later. The key is: we don\u2019t want perfect to be the enemy of useful, especially since you\u2019re making a near-term targeting decision.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Usually product marketing owns the final messaging, with sales leadership reviewing. The nice part is the blocks are editable, but still linked to drivers and evidence\u2014so when someone edits, they\u2019re not starting from scratch, and they\u2019re less likely to drift into \u201cgeneric claims.\u201d We can also set a cadence where you refresh recommendations quarterly as segments shift.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Given you\u2019ve already seen the concept, I\u2019d suggest we do a short working session: you bring a sample of customer data\u2014maybe 50\u2013100 accounts\u2014and we run a lightweight analysis to produce an example industry ranking and one segment\u2019s positioning package. If that resonates, we move straight into the annual subscription and onboarding plan. Would you be open to scheduling that for next week?",

    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Yes. I can pull a sample dataset and a support export. I\u2019ll need to loop in RevOps briefly for the CRM fields, but I can own it.",

I\u2019ll send a secure upload link and a simple checklist of the fields that are \u201cnice to have\u201d versus \u201cmust have,\u201d so you\u2019re not chasing everything. After the working session, if you feel good, we can finalize the order and target kickoff the following week.",

You can confirm what\u2019s easiest. I\u2019ll email all that today and include a calendar invite for a 60-minute working session next Wednesday. Does morning or afternoon work better?",

Update the summary/exemplar generation step to be deterministic (stable ordering, fixed sampling strategy, and versioned prompt/model inputs) and to upsert results per cluster rather than creating new records. Add a regression test that replays the same ingestion twice and asserts identical summary text/exemplar IDs (or stable selected conversation IDs) for each cluster.",

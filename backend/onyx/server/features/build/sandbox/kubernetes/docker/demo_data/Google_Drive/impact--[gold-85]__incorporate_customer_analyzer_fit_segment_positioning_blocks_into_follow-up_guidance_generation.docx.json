      "text": "This feature will make our follow-up guidance generation materially more context-aware by incorporating the Customer_Analyzer signals already available in the retrieval layer\u2014specifically fit score, segment, and approved positioning blocks. Instead of producing generic next-step recommendations, the system will tailor guidance and suggested messaging to the opportunity\u2019s predicted customer profile and the positioning language that has been vetted for that profile.\n\nThe primary user impact is higher relevance and consistency in sales follow-ups: reps will see recommendations that align with the customer\u2019s segment and reference approved messaging blocks, reducing time spent rewriting drafts and lowering the risk of off-brand or mismatched positioning. The deterministic selection rules (e.g., stable ordering, top-N blocks) ensure repeatable outputs across refreshes and teammates, which improves trust, collaboration, and downstream analytics on what guidance was shown.\n\nOperationally, this reduces variability and \u201crandomness\u201d in generated content, making it easier to evaluate performance and iterate on the approved positioning library. It also establishes a clear contract between the retrieval layer and generation layer, which should improve maintainability and enable future enhancements like segment-specific playbooks or A/B testing of positioning strategies.\n\nImportantly, the implementation includes graceful fallbacks to the existing follow-up flow when Customer_Analyzer data is missing, stale, or unmapped, so we avoid regressions and preserve reliability in edge cases. Unit and fixture tests will validate both that Customer_Analyzer fields are correctly reflected in generated guidance and that fallback behavior remains correct, protecting this integration as we evolve schemas and retrieval logic.",

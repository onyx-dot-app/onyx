      "text": "This feature will fix inconsistent experiment reporting caused by mismatched stage names and event mappings between CRM data and product events. By introducing a single normalization layer that translates source-specific stages/events into a canonical set of funnel stages, we ensure every messaging experiment is evaluated against the same definitions.\n\nThe primary impact is improved accuracy and stability of key experiment outcomes\u2014win rate, pipeline velocity, and conversion\u2014so results don\u2019t fluctuate simply because a source uses different terminology or emits slightly different events. This reduces false \u201cwins/losses,\u201d prevents teams from making decisions on noisy data, and increases confidence in experiment conclusions.\n\nOperationally, applying the same mapping consistently across both ingestion and query paths will eliminate discrepancies where historical data and live queries interpret the same experiment differently. This also simplifies debugging and future integrations by making stage/event semantics explicit in one place rather than duplicated across pipelines.\n\nFor product and go-to-market teams, the outcome is faster, more reliable iteration on messaging: dashboards become trustworthy, experiment comparisons become apples-to-apples, and insights can be shared broadly without caveats about data source differences. Longer term, canonical funnel stages create a foundation for cleaner analytics across other experiment types and reporting surfaces.",

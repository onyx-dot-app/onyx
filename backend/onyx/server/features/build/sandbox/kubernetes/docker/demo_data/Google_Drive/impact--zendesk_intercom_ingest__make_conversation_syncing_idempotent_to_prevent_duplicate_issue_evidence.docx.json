      "text": "This change makes our Zendesk/Intercom read-only ingest idempotent so repeated or overlapping sync runs don\u2019t create duplicate conversation records or re-attach the same evidence to multiple issues. Today, retries and overlapping time windows can inflate our dataset, causing the same customer conversation to appear multiple times.\n\nBy introducing idempotency keys (e.g., source + conversation/message IDs) and switching to upsert semantics, the ingest pipeline will deterministically update existing records instead of inserting new ones. This directly reduces duplicate evidence, improves trust in the underlying conversation store, and lowers downstream cleanup/support burden.\n\nCritically, deduplication will occur before clustering, ensuring issue themes, clustering outputs, and impacted-customer counts remain stable across sync runs. That stability improves the reliability of product insights and prevents misleading trend spikes caused by ingestion artifacts rather than real customer signal.\n\nOverall impact: higher data integrity, more consistent analytics and issue metrics, and safer operational behavior when syncs are retried or rerun. The user-visible outcome is fewer duplicate pieces of evidence on issues and more accurate customer impact reporting over time.",

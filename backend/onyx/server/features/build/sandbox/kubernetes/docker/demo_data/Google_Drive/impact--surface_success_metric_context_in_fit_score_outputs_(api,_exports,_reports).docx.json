      "text": "This feature ensures that every Fit Score returned through our read paths includes the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the number: the configured Success Metric definition and any associated weights. Today, Fit Scores can be consumed via API responses, CSV/PDF exports, and share links without the objective context used to optimize the model, which makes the score easy to misinterpret outside the original analysis.\n\nBy surfacing Success Metric context everywhere Fit Scores appear\u2014including downstream dashboards, reporting views, and third\u2011party integrations\u2014we reduce the risk of teams comparing or aggregating scores that were optimized for different goals (e.g., retention vs. expansion). This improves trust in the score, increases interpretability for cross-functional consumers, and lowers back-and-forth with analysts about what a given score represents.\n\nFrom a product and analytics standpoint, this standardizes Fit Score as a \u201cversioned\u201d output: score + metric definition (+ weights) as the minimum portable package. It enables more reliable reporting, improves auditability in exported artifacts, and supports better decision-making when Fit Scores are shared externally or across teams.\n\nFor older model versions that do not have an associated Success Metric definition, we\u2019ll include a clear fallback message in the same surfaces so consumers understand the limitation rather than assuming a default objective. This preserves backward compatibility while preventing silent confusion and sets a clear path for deprecating or upgrading legacy configurations over time.",

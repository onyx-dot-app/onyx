Add backend logic to detect duplicate/conflicting mappings when fetching or persisting integration configs, and return a structured warning/error payload identifying the conflicting fields. Provide a one-time remediation path (auto-dedup where safe, otherwise require user resolution) to prevent legacy bad configs from degrading integration performance.",

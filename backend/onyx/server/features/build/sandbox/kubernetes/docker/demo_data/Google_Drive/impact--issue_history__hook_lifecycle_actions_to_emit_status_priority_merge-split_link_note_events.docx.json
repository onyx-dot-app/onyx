      "text": "This feature adds a consistent backend \u201cissue history\u201d event stream by hooking into existing Issue lifecycle mutation flows. When an issue\u2019s status or priority changes, when issues are merged or split, when notes are added, or when external work items are linked, the system will automatically emit and persist a corresponding history event without requiring callers to implement bespoke logging.\n\nThe primary impact is improved auditability and traceability: every meaningful change will have an authoritative record including actor and timestamp, plus the minimal payload needed to reconstruct what happened (e.g., status/priority from\u2192to, merge/split source/target issue IDs, note metadata, external system identifier and URL). This establishes a single source of truth for downstream consumers and future UI timelines.\n\nFrom a product and platform perspective, this unlocks a future \u201cIssue Timeline\u201d experience and enables integrations, analytics, compliance reporting, and debugging workflows that depend on reliable change histories. Because the work is implemented at the service layer and wired into existing mutations, it reduces the risk of missing events across different entry points (API, internal tools, automations) and standardizes behavior across the product.\n\nThis scope deliberately excludes any UI rendering; the deliverable is consistent event emission and storage. Success is measured by end-to-end coverage for the MVP event types across all relevant mutation paths, correctness of payload schemas, and confidence via automated tests that events are emitted exactly once per action with the right actor, timestamp, and references.",

Add endpoints to create/update/delete/list profiles at the org (and optionally user-default) scope and to apply a selected profile when computing an issue\u2019s aggregated score. Ensure backward compatibility by providing a default profile that mirrors the existing single-score behavior when no profile is selected.",

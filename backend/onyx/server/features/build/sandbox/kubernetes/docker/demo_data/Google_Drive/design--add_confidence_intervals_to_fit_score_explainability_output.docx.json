      "text": "### Overview\nWe will add confidence intervals (CIs) to the Fit Score explainability output at both segment and account levels. The goal is to help consumers distinguish high-confidence scores from noisy/low-signal ones without changing the core Fit Score value. This will require extending the scoring service to compute interval bounds, surfacing those bounds through the API/SDK explainability payload, and ensuring the change is backwards-compatible for existing clients.\n\n### Confidence interval computation\nIn the scoring service, we will compute a lower and upper bound for each reported Fit Score (segment-level and the aggregated account-level score). The implementation will reuse existing signal statistics already available in the scorer (e.g., sample size / event counts, variance or residual/error proxy, and any model calibration metadata). For low-signal segments (e.g., sparse data, low counts), the interval should widen and may be capped to valid score limits (e.g., [0, 1] or [0, 100] depending on the score scale). For high-signal segments, the interval should tighten. We will implement a deterministic method (no sampling) to keep latency stable and make results unit-testable.\n\n### API/SDK and payload shape (backwards compatible)\nWe will extend the explainability payload to include optional CI fields without modifying existing required fields. Proposed shape: add `confidenceInterval` (or `ci`) objects alongside each score node, e.g. `{ score, confidenceInterval: { lower, upper, level } }`, where `level` defaults to `0.95` and may be omitted if constant. The API will include these fields when available; older clients will ignore unknown fields. SDK types will be updated to mark CI fields optional, and any JSON serialization/deserialization will pass through fields unchanged.\n\n### Testing and rollout\nWe will add unit tests for interval generation covering: (1) low-signal segments produce wider intervals and remain within score bounds, (2) high-signal segments produce narrower intervals, and (3) account-level interval behaves sensibly relative to segment inputs (e.g., aggregation doesn\u2019t invert bounds). We will gate the feature behind a service flag/config to enable staged rollout, monitor payload sizes/latency, and confirm no breaking changes in downstream consumers before fully enabling by default.",

      "text": "This feature establishes the foundational backend for **segment-scoped, editable positioning templates** so teams can tailor messaging by customer segment (e.g., value propositions, differentiators, proof points, objections) instead of relying on a single global set of positioning content. By introducing a clear data model with sensible defaults, we reduce the friction to getting started while enabling meaningful customization where it matters most.\n\nDefining the **data model with versioning and audit fields** (who changed what, when, and which version is current) improves trust and governance for customer-facing messaging. It enables teams to iterate safely, understand change history, and potentially support future needs like rollback, approvals, or comparisons between versions\u2014without redesigning the system later.\n\nDelivering **minimal CRUD API endpoints** (fetch/update) with basic validation ensures the UI can reliably read and persist templates, while preventing malformed or incomplete positioning structures from being saved. Aligning authorization to existing workspace access guarantees that only permitted users can view or modify segment templates, maintaining consistency with current security and permission expectations.\n\nFinally, documenting the **API payload schema/contract** unblocks upcoming frontend work by making the integration deterministic: the UI will know exactly what fields to render, how defaults are represented, and how updates should be structured. This reduces integration churn, speeds subsequent feature delivery, and provides a stable interface for future expansion (additional template sections, richer validation, or more granular permissions).",

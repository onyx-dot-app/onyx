      "text": "James Choi: Hi Liliana\u2014James Choi here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I know you\u2019re busy at Jadecircuit Electronics, so I\u2019ll keep this tight. I\u2019m calling because a lot of product and revenue teams tell us they\u2019re being asked, \u201cWhich industries should we double down on next quarter?\u201d but the data is scattered across CRM, support, and product usage. Does that sound familiar?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-1"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Yes, definitely. We\u2019re debating a couple verticals right now, and everyone has a different opinion based on whatever data they\u2019re closest to.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s exactly the scenario Customer_Analyzer is built for. It\u2019s a SaaS tool that pulls together signals like CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, and support tickets\u2014and then it turns that into practical outputs you can act on. The two that matter most for a quick win are: segment fit scoring and positioning recommendations. Have you already standardized on an ICP, or is it still evolving?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: We have an ICP on paper, but in reality we keep bending it. And support load has been a big issue\u2014some segments churn less, but they\u2019re heavy on tickets.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Perfect example. One common use case we see is prioritizing which industries to target next quarter using retention and support burden signals\u2014not just revenue potential. Customer_Analyzer can take retention, expansion, support volume, and even ticket themes, and create a fit score by segment so you can see, \u201cThis industry retains well but costs us a ton in support,\u201d versus \u201cThis one is lower support and faster time-to-value.\u201d",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: That\u2019s interesting. We currently look at retention in a dashboard and support in another system, but we don\u2019t really combine them in a disciplined way.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Right\u2014and when those aren\u2019t combined, decisions become debate-driven. What\u2019s nice is the fit score isn\u2019t a black box you can\u2019t explain. It\u2019s tied to drivers\u2014like \u201cintegrates with X,\u201d \u201cuses feature Y weekly,\u201d \u201ctickets per account,\u201d \u201ctime to onboard,\u201d that kind of thing\u2014so when you present it internally, you can defend why one segment is a better bet next quarter.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-7"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Okay. How does it handle messaging, though? Because even if we pick a segment, our marketing team struggles to translate that into a clear story.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That leads into the second feature I think you\u2019d care about: positioning recommendations. Once you pick the segments you want to prioritize, Customer_Analyzer generates segment-specific messaging blocks\u2014like a value proposition, top use cases, key differentiators, proof points to collect, and even objection handling. It\u2019s grounded in observed customer language, so you\u2019re not guessing at what resonates.",

    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: When you say \u201cobserved customer language,\u201d where is that coming from?",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: A few places\u2014support tickets are a big one because they contain the actual phrases customers use when they\u2019re frustrated or when something is working. It can also pull in onboarding surveys, interview notes if you have them, and even sales notes in CRM. The output is editable\u2014think website hero copy variants, sales deck bullets, and email openers\u2014so your team can refine it, but you\u2019re starting from evidence-based drafts rather than a blank page.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: That would help. We\u2019ve been rewriting messaging every quarter and it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s actually improving performance.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly. And because the recommendations are linked back to the underlying drivers and evidence, your team can see \u201cWe\u2019re claiming this differentiator because accounts in this segment repeatedly cite it and have higher retention,\u201d versus \u201cWe think it sounds good.\u201d That tends to speed up alignment between product, marketing, and sales\u2014less back-and-forth, fewer opinion wars.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-13"
    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: Makes sense. What would you need from us to get something useful out of it? I\u2019m always wary of tools that take months to set up.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-14"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally fair. For an initial pass, we typically start lightweight: export of a few CRM fields for segmentation, a basic retention/churn view by industry, and support ticket metadata plus a sample of ticket text. If product usage events are accessible, great, but you can get value even without perfect instrumentation. The goal for the first couple weeks is to answer one question: \u201cWhich industries should Jadecircuit target next quarter when you factor in retention and support burden?\u201d",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-15"
    },

      "text": "James Choi: Great timing then. Let me ask: who usually owns that decision\u2014marketing, product, revenue leadership?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: It\u2019s a mix. Marketing proposes, sales pushes back, and product cares because support load becomes their problem too.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-18"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s the classic triangle. In the full walkthrough, I\u2019d show you two things: first, how the fit score looks by industry with drivers like retention and support burden weighted in; second, how the positioning recommendations turn the \u201cwhy this segment\u201d into \u201chow we talk to them.\u201d The outcome is you can go into a planning meeting with a prioritized list and a messaging starter kit.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-19"

    {
      "text": "Liliana Zamora: I like the idea of having the objection-handling piece too. Sales always asks for that, and marketing never has time to produce it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7626006-20"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly\u2014and the objection handling is tied to real patterns we see in your signals. For example, if one segment consistently pushes back on implementation time, the playbook will suggest framing and proof points to collect\u2014like \u201ctime-to-value in X days\u201d or \u201cintegration checklist\u201d\u2014so you can proactively address it.",

      "text": "James Choi: The next step is a full 30\u201345 minute call where I can show a sample workflow end-to-end and we can map it to your data sources. If it\u2019s helpful, we can also outline a quick pilot focused on your next-quarter industry prioritization\u2014one question, one deliverable.

To make it productive, I\u2019ll include a short checklist of the fields and exports that help\u2014CRM segmentation fields, retention by industry, and support ticket data. If you can\u2019t pull everything by then, no worries\u2014we can still walk through and identify gaps.",

Surface actionable error messaging (e.g., missing permissions, issue not found) and provide a \u201cRefresh from Jira/Linear\u201d / \u201cPush update\u201d manual re-sync action that calls the existing sync endpoints. This reduces the perceived \u201clink-only\u201d workflow by making two-way sync visible and self-serve.",

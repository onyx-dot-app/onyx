      "text": "This change adds regression tests to ensure our positioning generator doesn\u2019t fall back to generic, uncited claims when customer evidence is available. Today, evidence-rich segments can still occasionally produce \u201csafe\u201d language that reads like boilerplate, which weakens credibility and creates downstream rework for PMM and Sales Enablement.\n\nThe tests will validate that, whenever evidence exists for a target segment, generated positioning includes verbatim customer snippets and correct citations. This protects the core promise of the feature: outputs should be anchored in real customer voice and attributable sources, not inferred marketing language.\n\nWe\u2019ll add fixtures that cover three critical scenarios: (a) evidence-rich segments where citations and snippets are mandatory, (b) sparse-evidence segments where the output must explicitly indicate low-evidence rather than invent claims, and (c) mixed-source inputs to ensure the generator attributes statements to the correct source. In the evidence-rich case, the suite will hard-fail if the generator returns uncited or generic positioning.\n\nImpact: higher trust and consistency in generated positioning, fewer review cycles to \u201cadd proof,\u201d and reduced risk of shipping claims that can\u2019t be substantiated. It also gives engineering an early warning system for future model/prompt changes that might degrade evidence usage or attribution.",

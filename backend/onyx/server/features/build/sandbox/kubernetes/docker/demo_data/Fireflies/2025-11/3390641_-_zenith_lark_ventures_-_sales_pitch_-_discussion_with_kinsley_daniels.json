      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Hi Kinsley\u2014Arjun Mehta here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll keep it brief: I work with teams that are trying to get really crisp on which customer segments are actually a strong fit and then translate that into messaging that converts. Does that match what you\u2019re focused on at Zenith Lark Ventures right now?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Kinsley Daniels: Yeah, it does. We\u2019re investing in a couple portfolio companies where ICP is still fuzzy, and even internally we debate whether we should lean SMB or mid-market for a few initiatives.",

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: That\u2019s exactly the gap Customer_Analyzer is built for. It\u2019s a SaaS tool that ingests your customer signals\u2014CRM fields, onboarding survey data, usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and outputs two things: a fit score per account/segment and practical positioning recommendations you can use in outbound and landing pages.",

    {
      "text": "Kinsley Daniels: Okay. How is the \u201cfit score\u201d determined? I\u2019ve seen a lot of scoring models that feel subjective.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7666440-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Totally fair. The fit estimation is driven by fit drivers you define\u2014so it\u2019s transparent and adjustable. For example: firmographics like industry and company size, technographics, problem severity, willingness to pay, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, and churn-risk signals. Then it produces a 0\u2013100 fit score, plus a driver breakdown that shows *why* the score is high or low, and segment comparisons\u2014like SMB vs mid-market\u2014based on actual outcomes such as retention, expansion, and conversion.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Not necessarily a ton, but we do need *some* signals. For early teams, we usually start with what you already have: CRM stage outcomes, a handful of onboarding responses, basic product usage, and support themes. The first pass is about getting directional clarity\u2014what\u2019s looking like high-fit versus low-fit\u2014and then refining as more data comes in. The key is the driver breakdown makes it easy to challenge and calibrate the model with your team.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Exactly. Instead of \u201cmid-market feels better,\u201d you can see: mid-market has higher willingness-to-pay and better retention, but longer time-to-value; SMB activates faster but generates more support burden. Then the tool recommends an ICP profile based on what correlates with success for *your* product, not generic benchmarks.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: In practice, it outputs segment-specific messaging components: value propositions, differentiators, proof points, and objection handling. So if you\u2019re doing the classic two-tier approach\u2014SMB vs mid-market\u2014you can create two landing page narratives and two outbound angles that match what each segment actually cares about and where your product is strongest.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Kinsley Daniels: That\u2019s one of our near-term needs. We\u2019re trying to split messaging but keep it grounded in reality, not just \u201cSMB wants simplicity, mid-market wants control.\u201d",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7666440-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Right\u2014and Customer_Analyzer helps you avoid stereotypes. For example, it might surface that SMB in a specific industry has unusually high problem severity and expands quickly, making it a better segment than mid-market in another industry that churns due to implementation complexity. The fit score plus driver breakdown gives you that nuance, and the positioning recs turn it into copy and talk tracks you can use.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Typical path is: connect the main data sources\u2014often your CRM and product events first\u2014map 6\u201310 fit drivers, and within a couple weeks you have a first set of segment comparisons and an initial recommended ICP profile. Then you can immediately apply it to one use case: two landing pages (SMB vs mid-market) and a simple outbound sequence per segment with proof points and objections.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: It\u2019s not. Most of the lift is choosing the drivers and agreeing on what \u201csuccess\u201d means for you\u2014renewal, expansion, activation, sales cycle length\u2014things you already track. From there, the system does the scoring and keeps the reasoning visible so your team can pressure-test it.",

Then it will point to the top drivers contributing to each score and recommend the ICP attributes that align with the higher-retention, higher-conversion cohorts.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Perfect. The best next step is a 30-minute working session where we pick one company, define the success outcome you care about, and outline the fit drivers and data sources you already have.

      "text": "### Overview\nWe need to audit our forecasting and recommendation (best-next-action) scoring to quantify whether the \u201cfit tier\u201d component is overpowering deal-dynamics signals (procurement stage, competition, internal alignment). This feature will add scoring instrumentation plus a lightweight offline analysis script that produces a report over recent accounts/opportunities, correlating score breakdowns to downstream outcomes. The primary deliverable is evidence: where and how often high-fit opportunities receive high overall scores despite materially negative deal dynamics, and what weight thresholds would prevent that.\n\n### Instrumentation / Data Model\nIn both the forecasting scorer and the recommendation scorer, we will log a structured \u201cscore contribution breakdown\u201d per scored entity (account/opportunity) at scoring time. The log payload will include: entity identifiers, timestamp/model version, final score, fit tier value and contribution, each deal-dynamics signal value and contribution (procurement stage, competition, internal alignment), and any gating/normalization factors (e.g., missing-signal defaults). Logs will be emitted to our existing analytics/event pipeline (or a dedicated table) with a stable schema so we can compare runs across code changes and create regression baselines.\n\n### Analysis Script + Report Output\nWe will add a small script (e.g., notebook or CLI) that pulls the last N days of scored entities, joins to ground-truth outcomes (e.g., stage progression, win/loss, time-to-close, no-progress), and computes: (1) correlation/association between each contribution and outcomes, (2) distributions of contribution ratios (fit vs deal dynamics), and (3) a \u201cpathology\u201d cohort: high-fit + negative deal dynamics where overall score remains above a chosen cutoff. The script will output a concise report (CSV + charts) listing aggregate metrics plus concrete examples (top K entities) to support qualitative review.\n\n### Success Criteria / Follow-ups\nSuccess is a reproducible report that quantifies overweighting (if present), highlights representative cases, and produces actionable targets: proposed max contribution share for fit tier, and threshold-based guardrails (e.g., when deal dynamics are strongly negative, overall score must drop below X). We will also produce a set of regression test cases from flagged entities (frozen inputs + expected contribution ranges) to be used by subsequent tickets that adjust weights, ensuring we don\u2019t reintroduce the imbalance across releases.",

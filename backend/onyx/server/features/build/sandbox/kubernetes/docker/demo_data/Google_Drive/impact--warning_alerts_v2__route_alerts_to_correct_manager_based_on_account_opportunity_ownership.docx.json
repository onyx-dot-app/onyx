      "text": "This change ensures Warning Alerts v2 notifications reliably reach the correct manager by routing alerts using the account/opportunity management hierarchy instead of sending only to the deal owner or a default channel. By leveraging CRM-derived owner/manager fields, the alert system will reflect the real operational chain of ownership for each account and opportunity.\n\nThe primary impact is improved accountability and faster response: the person responsible for oversight will consistently see risk signals, reducing the chance of missed or delayed action when deal owners are out of office, misassigned, or not the right escalation point. This also reduces noise in default channels and prevents repeated manual forwarding of alerts to the right leader.\n\nTo make routing predictable and resilient, the system will implement a deterministic fallback when manager data is missing, stale, or otherwise unavailable. This avoids silent failures and ensures every alert has a clear recipient path while making edge-case behavior consistent across teams and regions.\n\nFinally, lightweight logging will record the resolved recipient and the fallback reason used (if any) to support troubleshooting and auditing without changing alert content. This will help Sales Ops/RevOps and engineering quickly diagnose routing issues, validate CRM data quality, and reduce time-to-resolution when recipients report missing or misrouted alerts.",

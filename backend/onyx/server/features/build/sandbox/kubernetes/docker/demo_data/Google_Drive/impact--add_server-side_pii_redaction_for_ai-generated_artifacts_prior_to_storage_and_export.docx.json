      "text": "This feature adds a server-side PII detection and redaction step for AI-generated artifacts (emails, call notes, and next-best-action text) before content is persisted and before it is returned through any export/share APIs. When enabled, sensitive fields such as email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses will be masked so downstream systems and users never receive unredacted content from storage or export pathways.\n\nThe primary impact is risk reduction: it materially lowers the chance of storing or distributing sensitive customer data via AI outputs, improving compliance posture (e.g., internal security requirements, customer contractual terms, and privacy expectations) and reducing blast radius in the event of log, export, or data access issues. It also increases customer trust and unblocks adoption for more regulated tenants who currently avoid AI features due to PII concerns.\n\nOperationally, the implementation is intentionally centralized to avoid duplicating existing RBAC, audit logging, and retention logic. Redaction will be applied consistently across UI and API entrypoints, ensuring there are no bypass paths where unredacted artifacts could be stored or exported. A per-tenant configuration flag (default off) allows controlled rollout, tenant-by-tenant enablement, and safe experimentation without changing default behavior.\n\nFor observability and governance, the system will record metadata indicating that redaction was applied, including the policy and version used, enabling audits and future policy upgrades. Importantly, when redaction is enabled, raw PII must never be stored in audit/event payloads\u2014ensuring telemetry and audit trails remain useful without reintroducing sensitive data into secondary data stores.",

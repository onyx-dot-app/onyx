      "text": "Adding confidence intervals to the Fit Score explainability output will make segment- and account-level Fit Scores easier to interpret by showing not just a point estimate, but the expected range of uncertainty. This directly improves decision quality for users who rely on Fit Scores for prioritization and targeting, especially in cases where the underlying data is sparse or noisy.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, confidence intervals enable clearer guidance in the UI and downstream workflows: high scores with tight intervals can be treated as strong signals, while similar scores with wide intervals can be flagged as \u201cneeds more data\u201d or \u201clower confidence.\u201d This reduces overconfidence in borderline rankings, improves trust in the model, and provides a foundation for future features like reliability-based sorting, filtering, and alerts.\n\nThe change will be delivered by extending the scoring service to calculate interval bounds and returning them in the explainability payload for both segments and accounts. The API/SDK will include these new fields in a backwards-compatible way so existing consumers are unaffected unless they opt in to reading the new interval values.\n\nQuality and correctness will be supported with unit tests that validate interval generation across low-signal and high-signal segments, ensuring intervals behave as expected (e.g., wider when data is limited, narrower when evidence is strong). This mitigates the risk of misleading outputs and establishes confidence intervals as a stable contract for future explainability improvements.",

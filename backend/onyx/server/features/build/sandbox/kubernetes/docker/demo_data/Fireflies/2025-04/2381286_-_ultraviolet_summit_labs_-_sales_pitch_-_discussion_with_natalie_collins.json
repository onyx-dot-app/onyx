      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Natalie\u2014Mina Park here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll keep this quick. I\u2019m calling because we built Customer_Analyzer to help product and go-to-market teams get crisp on who their best customers are and how to position to win more of them, using the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes.",

      "text": "Natalie Collins: Hi Mina, sure. We\u2019re in between meetings, but I can do a quick overview. What are you seeing teams struggle with that you solve?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: The most common pattern is: teams have lots of customer data, but it doesn\u2019t translate into a shared view of \u201cthese are our highest-fit segments\u201d and \u201cthis is the message that actually resonates with them.\u201d So Customer_Analyzer does two things: it helps you prioritize segments with a fit score, and then it generates positioning recommendations\u2014editable messaging blocks\u2014based on the fit drivers and the actual language customers use.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Both. The feature I\u2019d highlight is our positioning_recommendation module. Once you\u2019ve identified a prioritized segment, it outputs a segment-specific value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, proof points you should collect, pricing/value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook. And it\u2019s not just a generic doc\u2014it\u2019s packaged as usable blocks: website hero copy, sales deck bullets, email openers. Each block links back to the underlying drivers and evidence so product, marketing, and sales can all see \u201cwhy this claim is true.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Natalie Collins: Interesting. We\u2019ve been trying to tighten ICP and messaging, but it tends to be opinion-based. How does it decide what\u2019s \u201chigh fit\u201d?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great question. We ingest your existing signals\u2014whatever you trust today: CRM attributes, onboarding responses, usage events, support patterns, and notes from calls. Then we identify the drivers that correlate with success outcomes you care about\u2014things like time-to-value, expansion, retention, or faster deal cycles. The fit score is essentially \u201chow closely does this segment match what your product is currently best at delivering,\u201d and it\u2019s transparent: you can see which drivers contributed and which data points supported it.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. We\u2019re designed for \u201cstart small.\u201d Most teams begin with two or three sources\u2014often CRM + product usage + a lightweight survey\u2014or even CRM + interview notes. You can get value without perfect instrumentation. The point is to move from scattered inputs to a prioritized segment view and messaging you can immediately test in outbound, on the website, and in discovery calls.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s one of the strongest use cases: product planning. Because once you see which segments are highest fit and what their unmet needs are\u2014based on patterns in tickets, usage drop-offs, interview language\u2014you can make cleaner roadmap bets. Instead of \u201cwe should build X because we heard it twice,\u201d you can say \u201cthis is a high-fit segment with consistent unmet need around Y; solving Y improves retention and expands the addressable footprint inside that segment.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: We handle that in two ways. First, you can define the outcomes you want to optimize for\u2014like expansion potential or enterprise readiness\u2014so the fit scoring doesn\u2019t over-index on \u201ceasy small customers\u201d if that\u2019s not strategic. Second, positioning recommendations explicitly include \u201cproof points to collect\u201d and \u201cobjections to address,\u201d which is helpful when you\u2019re moving upmarket or into a newer segment\u2014so you can run targeted experiments and build evidence rather than guessing.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Say you identify a segment like \u201cmid-market teams with high onboarding completion but recurring support requests around integrations.\u201d The output might recommend a value proposition emphasizing faster time-to-value with fewer workflow breaks, differentiators around your integration approach, proof points like integration setup time or support deflection, plus an objection-handling playbook\u2014for example, \u201cwe already have tooling for this\u201d or \u201cyour platform seems complex.\u201d And then it gives you ready-to-edit blocks: a homepage hero line, 3 sales deck bullets, and an email opener tailored to that segment.",

      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9916329-16"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. And because the recommendations are tied back to observed customer language\u2014pulled from tickets, surveys, and notes\u2014you get that \u201cthis is how customers describe the problem\u201d angle, not internal jargon. That tends to tighten marketing and sales alignment fast.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Typically, week one is connecting the first sources\u2014often CRM and one other system\u2014and agreeing on the success outcomes you want to model. Week two is producing the first cut of fit scoring and a couple prioritized segments. Then we generate positioning recommendations for those segments and run a working session to edit and turn them into assets you can deploy. Most teams see something actionable in the first two weeks, without a big IT lift.",

      "text": "Natalie Collins: And is this replacing what we do in research? Or augmenting it?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Augmenting. It\u2019s not trying to replace qualitative discovery; it helps you scale it. It turns scattered qualitative and quantitative signals into a coherent picture, then gives you a structured way to translate that into messaging and product bets. Many teams use it to decide where to do deeper interviews next\u2014because you can see which segments are high fit but poorly understood, or where unmet needs cluster.",

      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s perfect, and honestly that\u2019s when it works best\u2014when product, marketing, and sales can look at the same drivers and messaging. Would it be reasonable to set up a 45-minute session next week with you plus whoever owns positioning\u2014maybe product marketing\u2014and someone from sales? I can walk through a sample workflow, show the positioning blocks, and we can talk through your current segments and what data you already have.",

Two, what systems do you have today for customer signals\u2014CRM, analytics, support?",

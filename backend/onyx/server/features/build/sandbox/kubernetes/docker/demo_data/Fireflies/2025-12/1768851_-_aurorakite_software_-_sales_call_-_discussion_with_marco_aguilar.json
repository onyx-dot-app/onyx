    },
    {
      "text": "Marco Aguilar: Yep, still the priority. We\u2019ve got pressure from leadership to pick two verticals and go hard, but we\u2019re not confident we\u2019re reading the signals right.",

      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Makes sense. For today, I want to focus on Customer_Analyzer\u2019s positioning recommendations\u2014specifically how it takes your retention and support-ticket patterns and turns them into segment-specific messaging and an objection playbook. The goal would be: by the end of this call, we agree on a pilot scope and what \u201cgood\u201d looks like. Sound fair?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair, and we should address that head-on. Quick recap: Customer_Analyzer ingests signals from your CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, and support tickets. Then it produces (1) a fit score by segment, and (2) positioning recommendations tied back to the actual drivers and evidence. The piece you were most interested in last time was turning all that into usable messaging without weeks of workshops. Is that the part you want to test first?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3429461-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Marco Aguilar: Yes\u2014messaging and segment guidance. But the scoring is only as good as the CRM, and our CRM is\u2026 not great. Industry tags are inconsistent, and a lot of accounts are missing key fields. Usage data exists but it\u2019s not cleanly tied to accounts.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3429461-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Got it. Let me propose a pragmatic approach: we don\u2019t start by boiling the ocean. For the pilot, we pick two candidate industries you\u2019re already debating\u2014say, FinTech vs. Logistics, or whatever is real for you\u2014and we use only the strongest signals you trust. For example: renewal/retention by account, ticket volume and category, and whatever usage events you feel are reliable. Then Customer_Analyzer generates positioning blocks for each segment: a value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, and a short objection-handling playbook\u2014plus editable copy you can use in an email opener or deck.",

    {
      "text": "Marco Aguilar: The outputs sound great. My concern is we\u2019ll spend the entire pilot cleaning data and still not trust the recommendation.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s the common fear. Two things we do to avoid that. First, we show you what evidence each recommendation is based on\u2014like \u201chigh retention correlates with X workflow usage and low support burden in these accounts.\u201d Second, we can start with a \u201cminimum viable\u201d dataset. If industry is messy, we can segment by something you do have\u2014like product tier, primary use case from onboarding surveys, or even support-ticket taxonomy\u2014then map that back to industries once you\u2019re confident.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3429461-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Marco Aguilar: But we don\u2019t have onboarding surveys consistently either. Some teams used them, some didn\u2019t. And our support taxonomy changed mid-year, so categories aren\u2019t apples-to-apples.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3429461-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Okay\u2014so we have two data-quality risks: missing fields and inconsistent tagging. If we can\u2019t rely on those, we shift weight to what\u2019s stable. Do you have consistent retention data by account and ARR? And do tickets at least have raw text even if the categories changed?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s workable. In that case, positioning recommendations can lean more on ticket themes and language\u2014what customers actually complain about or praise\u2014and correlate that with retention outcomes. The platform will extract recurring \u201cfit drivers\u201d from the text and then produce messaging that mirrors customer language. It\u2019ll also suggest proof points to collect, like \u201ctime-to-resolution improved by X\u201d or \u201creduced manual reconciliation,\u201d so your team knows what to validate.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: You are\u2014and the difference is consistency and speed across segments. Instead of a few anecdotes, you get a structured set of messaging blocks for each prioritized segment, tied to measurable outcomes like retention and support burden. So when you pick industries next quarter, marketing and sales have a coherent narrative, not five versions of the same pitch.",

    {
      "text": "Marco Aguilar: I hear you. Another issue: who on my team is actually going to maintain this? We\u2019re lean. If it requires ongoing field hygiene or constant re-tagging, it\u2019s a non-starter.",

Typically, for a pilot, we set up a lightweight cadence: one owner on your side for 30 minutes a week to review outputs and confirm assumptions. On the data side, we can start with exports rather than full integrations, just to prove value.",

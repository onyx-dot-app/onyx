      "text": "This feature adds a recommendation layer to Warning Alerts v3 that turns model output (risk score + ranked risk drivers) into a short, actionable set of next steps for sellers. Instead of showing \u201cwhy\u201d an opportunity is at risk only, we will also provide 3\u20135 suggested interventions with clear rationale and an explicit priority order, making the alert immediately usable in the flow of work.\n\nIn v1, recommendations will be deterministic and rule-based, mapping common risk drivers to proven playbook actions (e.g., \u201cschedule next meeting\u201d when next-step is missing, \u201creconfirm close plan\u201d when close date slips, \u201cre-engage champion\u201d when activity decays). Each recommendation can include any required CRM fields and deep links so the seller can complete the action with minimal context-switching, and so the UI can render consistent \u201cdo this now\u201d affordances.\n\nImpact-wise, this is expected to increase alert conversion from insight to action by reducing interpretation time and removing ambiguity about what to do next. It also standardizes best-practice responses across the team, helping newer reps execute the same interventions top performers would take, and creates a structured foundation for measuring which actions correlate with risk reduction and pipeline health improvements.\n\nEngineering and product quality are enforced through unit tests covering driver-to-intervention mappings, graceful behavior when driver evidence is missing, and a stable response schema that downstream UI can rely on. This reduces regressions as risk drivers evolve, keeps recommendations predictable (critical for seller trust), and makes it easier to iterate from v1 rules to more sophisticated strategies in later versions.",

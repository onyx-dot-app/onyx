Update these settings pages to respect the workspace mode by showing only the core, recommended controls by default and moving advanced options behind an explicit \u201cAdvanced settings\u201d section. Ensure the mode is consistently enforced on navigation/refresh and that switching to Advanced later reveals (not resets) the existing configuration.",

      "text": "This change improves initiation guidance quality by incorporating richer Customer_Analyzer context\u2014fit score, segment, and approved positioning blocks\u2014into the outreach messaging the system generates. Instead of relying solely on the existing initiation flow, the generator will tailor recommendations to what we already know about the customer, making messaging more relevant and aligned with validated positioning.\n\nFrom a user impact perspective, sellers should see clearer, more personalized suggested outreach that reflects the customer\u2019s segment and prioritizes the most applicable value propositions. By deterministically selecting which positioning blocks to include (e.g., always using the top N approved blocks), we ensure guidance is consistent across runs and easier for users to trust, compare, and iterate on.\n\nFrom a reliability and risk perspective, the generator will gracefully fall back to the current initiation behavior whenever Customer_Analyzer data is missing, stale, or otherwise unavailable. This prevents regressions in message generation and ensures users always receive usable guidance, even when upstream enrichment isn\u2019t present.\n\nFrom an engineering and quality perspective, adding unit/fixture tests that assert the Customer_Analyzer fields appear in the generated output reduces the chance of silent degradation as we evolve the prompt/templates and upstream schemas. This also establishes a baseline contract between Customer_Analyzer and initiation guidance that supports future expansion (e.g., different messaging strategies by segment or fit score thresholds).",

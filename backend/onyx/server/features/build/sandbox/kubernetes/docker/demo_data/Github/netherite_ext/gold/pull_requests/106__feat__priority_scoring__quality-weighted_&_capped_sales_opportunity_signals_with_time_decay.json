      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the priority scoring model to prevent sales/opportunity linkage from disproportionately driving issue priority.\n\nChanges:\n- Introduces an opportunity quality score computed from opportunity attributes (e.g., stage, ARR magnitude bucket, and ICP fit). The sales/opportunity contribution is now proportional to this quality score rather than a flat boost.\n- Adds exponential time decay to opportunity signals (based on opportunity last-updated/last-activity timestamp) so stale deal asks gradually lose influence.\n- Applies a hard cap to the aggregated sales/opportunity contribution at the scoring level to ensure it cannot dominate the total issue score.\n- Adds an evidence-aware cap: when support/customer evidence is sparse or missing, the sales/opportunity contribution is limited to not exceed the support/customer-evidence contribution (prevents high scores driven solely by sales linkage).\n\nImplementation details:\n- Refactors the scoring pipeline to compute `supportEvidenceScore` and `salesOpportunityScore` independently, then combines them with caps/guards applied before final normalization.\n- Adds configurable parameters for quality weighting, decay half-life, and max sales contribution (with sensible defaults) to keep tuning easy without code changes.\n- Updates unit tests/fixtures to cover: high-quality vs low-quality opportunities, stale vs recent opportunities, and scenarios with minimal support evidence to verify caps are enforced.\n\nUser impact:\n- Issue priority will more closely track validated customer/support evidence while still reflecting sales impact for high-quality, active opportunities; older or low-quality opportunities will no longer keep issues artificially elevated.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

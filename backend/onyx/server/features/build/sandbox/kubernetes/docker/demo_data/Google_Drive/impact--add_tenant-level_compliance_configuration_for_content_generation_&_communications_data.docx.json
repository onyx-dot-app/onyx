      "text": "This feature introduces a tenant-level compliance configuration that centrally governs two critical behaviors: whether AI-driven content generation is permitted, and which communications data sources/fields may be ingested for downstream use. By making these controls tenant-scoped, we can support regulated and non-regulated customers on the same platform while ensuring policy differences are enforced consistently across environments.\n\nOperationally, the configuration will be persisted and exposed through an internal admin endpoint, allowing teams to enable/disable generation, restrict ingestion scopes, and apply required defaults without shipping custom code per tenant. This reduces implementation friction for new enterprise deployments and shortens the turnaround time for compliance-driven changes (e.g., when legal/security requirements evolve).\n\nAt runtime, the system will enforce hard blocks on any disallowed content generation or data ingestion paths based on the tenant\u2019s settings. This materially lowers compliance risk by preventing accidental exposure of restricted data to AI workflows and ensuring we have deterministic, auditable behavior aligned with tenant policy.\n\nThe expected impact is improved enterprise readiness and faster sales/procurement cycles, with fewer bespoke deployments and clearer separation of responsibilities between platform policy and application logic. It also provides a foundation for future compliance controls (e.g., region-specific defaults, per-feature allowlists, and audit logging of enforcement decisions) without re-architecting tenant onboarding.",

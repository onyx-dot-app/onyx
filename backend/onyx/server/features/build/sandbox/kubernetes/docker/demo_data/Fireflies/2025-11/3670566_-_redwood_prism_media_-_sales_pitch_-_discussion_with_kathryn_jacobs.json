      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Perfect\u2014I'll keep it tight. I\u2019m calling because we work with product and revenue teams to get really clear on who their best customers are and how to message to those segments. The product is called Customer_Analyzer. It pulls signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets\u2014and turns that into a fit score and a simple \u201chere\u2019s how to position\u201d recommendation. Curious\u2014are you doing any ICP work right now at Redwood Prism Media?",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair. The reason I\u2019m reaching out is because a lot of teams *think* they have an ICP, but when they start scaling outbound or paid, the real question becomes: which segments actually convert, onboard quickly, stick around, and expand\u2014and which ones look good on paper but churn or soak support. Customer_Analyzer\u2019s main feature is fit estimation: it assigns a 0\u2013100 fit score at the account and segment level and shows the driver breakdown\u2014why that segment is high or low fit.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Makes sense. Where we tend to be different is we don\u2019t just report what happened\u2014we connect multiple signals to explain *why* and make it usable for GTM. For example, you might see Mid-market \u201cMedia & Entertainment\u201d looks fine in CRM, but when you blend in product adoption patterns and support burden, the score drops\u2014and the driver breakdown shows it\u2019s a time-to-value issue or onboarding friction. Then the segment comparison helps you decide, \u201cDo we fix onboarding for this segment, or do we focus spend elsewhere?\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally. Even with a known buyer, the use case we see a lot is validating the ICP *before* scaling spend\u2014especially if you\u2019re thinking about expanding campaigns or pushing into adjacent verticals. If you\u2019re about to put budget behind a segment, a fit score plus driver breakdown can prevent you from paying to acquire customers who look similar but don\u2019t succeed.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Understood. In that case, one lightweight way teams use it is to tighten focus with the same resources\u2014prioritize the highest-fit segments for sales effort and messaging, and deprioritize the ones that generate pipeline but don\u2019t close or renew. Quick question: do you see any pattern where certain types of accounts take longer to onboard or require more support than others?",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s fair. Implementation is usually the big concern. We typically start with the signals you already have in the CRM plus a small export of product usage or support tags\u2014no heavy lift. The first output is basically: top segments by fit, the bottom segments, and the key drivers. It\u2019s meant to be a fast diagnostic rather than a months-long project.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Absolutely\u2014if you have bandwidth internally, that can work. The thing we hear is: analysts can produce a one-off report, but it\u2019s hard to keep it current and tie it directly to positioning. Customer_Analyzer keeps the scoring updated as new accounts come in, and it translates the insight into practical messaging\u2014value props, differentiators, proof points, and even objection handling aligned to that segment\u2019s drivers.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: I get the skepticism. The recommendations are grounded in your own outcomes. So if the driver breakdown shows your best-fit customers consistently have high problem severity and fast time-to-value, the messaging focuses on that\u2014what resonates, what proof to use, and what objections typically show up for lower-fit accounts. It\u2019s not \u201cgeneric AI copy\u201d\u2014it\u2019s derived from your patterns.",

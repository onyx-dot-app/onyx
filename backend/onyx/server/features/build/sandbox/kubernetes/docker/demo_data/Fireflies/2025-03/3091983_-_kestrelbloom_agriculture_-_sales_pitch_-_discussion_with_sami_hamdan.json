I\u2019ll be quick: I\u2019m calling because we\u2019ve been helping revenue teams get a more reliable forecast and clearer \u201cwhat should I do next\u201d guidance without ripping out Salesforce. Is now still okay?",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Perfect. The product is Sales_Accelerator\u2014it sits on top of Salesforce or HubSpot and turns what\u2019s already in your CRM plus activity signals\u2014emails, calls, meetings\u2014into an explainable forecast and next-step recommendations per opportunity. Most teams we talk to have two pain points: forecasts that swing late in the quarter, and reps who aren\u2019t sure what action will actually move a deal forward. Does either sound familiar?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7371680-3"

    {
      "text": "Sami Hamdan: Both, honestly. Forecast accuracy is a constant battle. And coaching reps to run consistent follow-ups is another.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s exactly where Sales_Accelerator focuses. On forecasting, it doesn\u2019t just look at stage\u2014it weights signals like stage age, last touch, whether a next meeting is scheduled, and historical win rates for similar deals. Then it produces commit/best-case/pipeline views and flags slippage risk early\u2014so you\u2019re not discovering in week 12 that half your \u201ccommit\u201d deals are stale.",

      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7371680-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great question. The difference is it combines CRM stage data with real activity and cycle-time benchmarks, and it explains the \u201cwhy\u201d behind each forecast number. So instead of \u201cthis is in stage 3,\u201d you\u2019ll see drivers like \u201cstage age is 2x benchmark,\u201d \u201cno customer meeting booked,\u201d \u201clast outbound was 10 days ago,\u201d or \u201csimilar deals from this segment historically convert at X%.\u201d That makes it coachable, not just reportable.",

    {
      "text": "Sami Hamdan: The explainable part is interesting. Our leadership always asks why the model says what it says. But we also have an ICP project running\u2014how does that play in?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Perfect timing. Sales_Accelerator is designed to consume fit scoring and positioning work from a system like Customer_Analyzer, not duplicate it. If you already have fit tiers or positioning blocks, we can use them as a weighting factor in forecast and prioritization\u2014so your team isn\u2019t just chasing \u201clate-stage\u201d deals, they\u2019re focusing on late-stage deals that match your best-fit profile.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally fair. The second piece I wanted to highlight is best-next-action guidance inside the deal flow. One common use case is after discovery: the AE gets a follow-up recommendation that drafts a recap email, pulls two approved proof points from your positioning library, and helps create a mutual action plan with due dates and stakeholders\u2014so multi-threading and next steps are standardized.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7371680-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sami Hamdan: That would help. We see deals stall because the follow-up is inconsistent, and the mutual plan lives in someone\u2019s head.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7371680-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. And when the mutual action plan isn\u2019t progressing\u2014no next meeting, no stakeholder added, tasks slipping\u2014Sales_Accelerator triggers an early warning that the deal is at risk. That\u2019s when managers can intervene with something concrete: \u201cBook the technical review with Ops by Friday,\u201d rather than \u201cpush harder.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Usually lightweight. Because it sits on top of your CRM, we start by connecting Salesforce, mapping a few core fields, and pulling your activity signals. Then we configure cycle-time benchmarks based on your historical data. If you have fit tiers from Customer_Analyzer, we connect those too. The goal is to get you useful forecasts and risk flags quickly\u2014then iterate with sales ops and a pilot group.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Day to day: AEs and SDRs see deal-level guidance\u2014what to do next, what\u2019s missing, and drafted follow-ups. Managers and sales ops use the forecast views, slippage diagnostics, and scenario planning\u2014like \u201cif we add 20 SQLs in our Tier 1 ICP, what\u2019s the expected impact on the quarter?\u201d It gives you a lever to model outcomes, not just hope.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly\u2014this makes that debate data-driven. And because the forecast is explainable, you can defend it in your internal reviews: \u201cThese are the specific deals at risk and the drivers,\u201d plus \u201cthese activities are most correlated with movement for our Tier 1 accounts.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Two things for a next step. First, I\u2019d love to schedule a longer working session\u201430 to 45 minutes\u2014where we look at your current forecast process, which signals you trust, and where deals tend to slip. Second, if you\u2019re open to it, we can prep a light data checklist\u2014fields and activity sources\u2014so we can show you what Sales_Accelerator would flag on a handful of opportunities.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Ideally you, whoever owns sales ops or forecasting, and maybe one frontline manager or AE who can speak to the follow-up workflow after discovery. That way we cover both: forecast accuracy and rep execution.",

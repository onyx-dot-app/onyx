      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Xavier, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to get tighter on which customer segments Willowarc should double down on this quarter, and that the \u201cwho are we really best for?\u201d question keeps coming up in product planning. Does that still feel like the priority for today?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Xavier Walker: Yeah, that\u2019s exactly it. We have some traction in a few segments, but it\u2019s messy. We\u2019ve got opinions, some anecdotes, and a lot of spreadsheets. We need something we can actually align on\u2014product, marketing, and sales.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. For this second call, I want to keep it focused and get you to a clear next step. I\u2019ll walk through Customer_Analyzer briefly, then we\u2019ll go deeper on one capability: the positioning recommendations tied to fit drivers\u2014since that\u2019s what you showed interest in. Sound good?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great context. Customer_Analyzer ingests the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, support tickets, interview notes\u2014and it produces two core outputs: a fit score by segment and then positioning recommendations for the segments you choose to prioritize. The use case you called out\u2014product planning\u2014maps directly: identify high-fit customers with unmet needs to guide roadmap bets.",

    {
      "text": "Xavier Walker: The fit score is interesting, but I\u2019m cautious. I don\u2019t want a black box telling us \u201cthis segment is good\u201d without being able to defend why.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s a fair concern, and it\u2019s one we designed around. The way we avoid \u201cblack box\u201d is: every recommendation we generate is linked back to the underlying drivers and evidence. So if the product says \u201cMid-market financial ops teams are highest-fit,\u201d you can click into exactly what\u2019s driving that\u2014usage patterns, support themes, survey language, win/loss signals\u2014and see representative examples.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: More structured than a summary. Let\u2019s focus on the positioning_recommendation feature since that\u2019s where teams get aligned fastest. For any segment you prioritize, Customer_Analyzer generates editable messaging blocks\u2014like website hero copy, sales deck bullets, and email openers\u2014and then behind each block you\u2019ll see: the segment-specific value proposition, top use cases, key differentiators, proof points to collect, pricing/value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook.",

      "text": "Xavier Walker: Editable is good. We\u2019d never ship auto-generated copy without tweaking it. But I\u2019m also thinking about: how do you know you\u2019re picking up the right customer language? Some of our notes are messy.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6535455-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally. Two things help there. First, we\u2019re not relying on one source\u2014we triangulate across sources. If interview notes are messy but support tickets are consistent and usage events show a clear pattern, the system weights what\u2019s most reliable. Second, the evidence view will show you the quotes or themes it\u2019s using, so you can sanity-check: \u201cIs this real? Does this sound like our customers?\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Xavier Walker: Got it. Let\u2019s make it concrete. Suppose we\u2019re debating between two segments: enterprise treasury teams versus mid-market controllers. We\u2019re not sure which should drive the next two roadmap cycles.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6535455-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great example. Here\u2019s how we\u2019d run that in Customer_Analyzer. You\u2019d set those as segments\u2014using CRM fields like employee count, industry, role, and deal size\u2014then we pull in signals. The product would output fit drivers: maybe treasury teams show deeper usage in reconciliation and approvals, while controllers show higher activation but more churn risk due to integrations. Then, for each segment, the positioning recommendation gives you a narrative: what they\u2019re hiring your product to do, what they value most, and what proof points you should collect to win more consistently.",

    {
      "text": "Xavier Walker: And where does product planning come in beyond messaging?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: In two ways. One, unmet needs. If the support tickets and interview notes show \u201ctreasury teams keep asking for audit trails and policy controls,\u201d but your current strengths are more around speed and automation, the tool will flag that gap and show it as both a risk to fit and an opportunity for roadmap. Two, conversion leverage. If one segment is high-fit and your positioning is off\u2014meaning you\u2019re not leading with what they care about\u2014you can often unlock wins faster with messaging and enablement while product builds the deeper capabilities.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Xavier Walker: That\u2019s appealing. But I\u2019m still thinking about trust. If my head of product asks, \u201cWhy are we saying this is the differentiator?\u201d I need to point to something credible.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6535455-16"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Completely. In the positioning output, differentiators aren\u2019t just declared\u2014they\u2019re tied to drivers and evidence. For example, it might say \u201cFast time-to-value through guided onboarding,\u201d and you\u2019d see the supporting signals: shorter time-to-first-key-event in usage data, fewer onboarding-related support tickets, and customer phrasing from surveys like \u201cwe were live in a week.\u201d If the evidence is thin, it will mark it as a \u201cproof point to collect\u201d rather than a confident claim.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. And it helps sales and marketing stop guessing. You can turn it into a checklist: which case studies to pursue, what stats to validate, what questions to add to onboarding surveys. It\u2019s all in service of getting you to a segment you can win repeatedly.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: You won\u2019t need that. For a first pass, we typically start with the core systems you already have\u2014CRM plus either product events or support tickets. In week one, you can usually get initial fit drivers and a first set of positioning blocks for 1\u20132 segments. Then week two is refining\u2014validating with your team, adding one more signal source if needed, and tightening the objection handling playbook.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: The playbook is segment-specific. So for treasury teams, it might anticipate \u201cSecurity and controls\u201d objections and give you: recommended response structure, what proof points matter, and what not to say. For the internal-build objection, it might anchor on time-to-value and the fact that we connect evidence from multiple sources into actionable messaging\u2014so you\u2019re not just analyzing, you\u2019re shipping a narrative that sales and marketing can use tomorrow.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6535455-23"
    },
    {
      "text": "Xavier Walker: Makes sense. One more concern: if the model\u2019s recommending messaging, I worry it\u2019ll push us into generic \u201csave time, reduce costs\u201d statements that every SaaS company says.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s where the \u201cobserved customer language\u201d part matters. We\u2019re not starting from generic templates. We use the language your customers actually use\u2014pulled from surveys, support tickets, calls, notes\u2014and then map that to the fit drivers. So instead of \u201csave time,\u201d you might see \u201cclose the month without spreadsheet handoffs\u201d if that\u2019s what your controllers keep saying. And again, you can click through and see examples so it doesn\u2019t feel like vague marketing-speak.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: I\u2019d propose a tight pilot: two segments you\u2019re already debating\u2014like the treasury versus controllers example. We ingest CRM plus support tickets to start, generate fit drivers and positioning recommendations, and then we do a working session with you to review the evidence and edit the messaging blocks into something you\u2019d actually use in a deck and on the website. Success looks like: you can defend the segment choice, you have a clear \u201cwhy us\u201d story per segment, and you have 3\u20135 proof points to collect to strengthen it.",

Second, a quick alignment on the two segments and what \u201cgood\u201d means\u2014like win rate target, churn threshold, or expansion potential\u2014so we evaluate fit in your terms.",

      "text": "This feature adds server-side, immutable audit logging for all read paths that may expose customer signals containing PII, including API access, UI viewing of raw records, and any export/download actions. The intent is to ensure every instance of \u201cPII was accessed\u201d is consistently captured, regardless of whether the access occurred through product UI, integrations, or internal services acting on a customer\u2019s behalf.\n\nFrom a customer and compliance perspective, this materially strengthens our security posture by enabling reliable investigations, supporting regulatory and contractual audit requirements, and improving trust for security reviews. It reduces the risk of undetected data exposure by creating a durable trail of access events, and it enables faster incident response with clear attribution (who/what accessed which data, when, and how).\n\nOperationally, each audit event will include workspace, actor (user or service), timestamp, action type, resource identifiers, and request context (IP and user agent). Logs are stored in an append-only/immutable datastore to prevent tampering, and retrieval is restricted to admins via dedicated endpoints with basic filtering (time range, actor, resource) to make audits practical without broad data access.\n\nKey impacts to consider are increased write volume and storage costs proportional to read traffic (especially for high-traffic APIs and bulk exports), and the need to ensure logging does not add noticeable latency to read operations. We should also align retention and access controls with our privacy posture (e.g., minimizing sensitive data in logs while maintaining usefulness) and clearly document what is logged and how admins can retrieve it.",

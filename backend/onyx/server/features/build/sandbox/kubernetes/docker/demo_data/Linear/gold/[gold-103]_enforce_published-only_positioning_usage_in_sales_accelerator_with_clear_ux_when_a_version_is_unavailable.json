When a pinned version is missing or unpublished, return a structured error that the UI can render as a blocking state with an explicit reason and the last known pinned version as the only fallback. Update the messaging/recommendation UI to display the pinned positioning version and show a clear prompt to request Marketing publish a new variant rather than silently switching content.",

      "text": "This change improves the integrity of our prioritization system by preventing one-off sales asks from disproportionately inflating an issue or theme\u2019s priority score. Today, a single linked \u201cSales_Accelerator\u201d opportunity can materially boost priority, creating noise and encouraging reactive prioritization that may not reflect broader customer impact or strategic value.\n\nWe will introduce debouncing/gating for sales-driven uplifts: a sales/opportunity linkage will only contribute to priority once it meets a minimum evidence threshold (e.g., multiple distinct opportunities, or an opportunity corroborated by support conversations). This ensures sales signals act as validation of a repeated pattern rather than a trigger for immediate reprioritization based on a single deal.\n\nThe expected impact is a more stable and defensible roadmap: fewer priority spikes, less churn in planning, and reduced incentive to \u201cgame\u201d the system via opportunistic linking. Product and engineering teams should see a clearer separation between genuine market demand and isolated revenue-driven requests, while still preserving the ability for strong, repeated sales evidence to influence prioritization.\n\nTo maintain transparency, the issue UI and underlying issue object will explicitly record when a sales uplift is suppressed and why (e.g., \u201cinsufficient evidence threshold\u201d). This auditability helps explain prioritization decisions to Sales and other stakeholders, supports consistent governance, and enables follow-up actions (e.g., prompting for additional corroborating evidence) without losing visibility into the original signal.",

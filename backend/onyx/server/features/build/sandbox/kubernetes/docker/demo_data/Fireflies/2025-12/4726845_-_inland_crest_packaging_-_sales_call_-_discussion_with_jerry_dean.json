Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to get more disciplined about which customer segments Inland Crest should really lean into\u2014especially for product planning. I wanted to show you one piece of Customer_Analyzer that tends to get teams to a decision quickly: our fit estimation and the driver breakdown behind it.",

    {
      "text": "Jerry Dean: Sure. Though I\u2019ll tell you upfront\u2014internally we don\u2019t always agree on what \u201cgood customer\u201d means. Product, sales, marketing\u2026 they all argue.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: That\u2019s actually the most common reason teams adopt this. Customer_Analyzer is designed to create a shared view using signals you already collect. For Inland Crest, when you say product planning, are you trying to identify high-fit customers with unmet needs to guide roadmap bets? Or is it more about sales targeting?",

    {
      "text": "Jerry Dean: Product planning first. We\u2019ve had a couple roadmap projects based on loud customers that didn\u2019t pan out. But sales is going to push back if we tell them to stop chasing certain accounts.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Makes sense. So here\u2019s how fit estimation would help without it being \u201cArjun\u2019s opinion\u201d or \u201cProduct\u2019s opinion.\u201d You define fit drivers\u2014industry, size, problem severity, willingness to pay, time-to-value, adoption patterns, even support burden\u2014and then we compute a fit score 0\u2013100 at the account and segment level. The key is the driver breakdown: you can show exactly why a segment scores high or low.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Mostly product. We provide a guided setup, but the system computes it continuously once connected. Typically we connect CRM fields, onboarding survey answers if you have them, and product usage events if applicable.

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Totally fair. When fields are sparse, we start with what\u2019s reliable\u2014closed-won history, renewal outcomes, ticket volume, onboarding survey themes\u2014and we can weight drivers accordingly. Even with imperfect data, you can still get segment comparisons: like mid-market manufacturers versus smaller distributors, and see which group actually retains and expands.",

It\u2019s not a black box score\u2014every score comes with \u201chere are the drivers.\u201d For example, a segment might score 82 because time-to-value is fast, support burden is low, and willingness to pay is high. Another might score 51 because support tickets spike and churn risk signals are elevated. You can take that into a product planning meeting and argue from evidence rather than gut feel.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Understood. One way teams handle that is agreeing upfront on what outcomes matter. If the goal is roadmap bets that drive retention and expansion, then the fit drivers align to that: retention, adoption, support burden, expansion. It reframes the conversation. Instead of \u201cwho do we like,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cwho succeeds with us.\u201d",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Then I\u2019d recommend avoiding a big workshop. We can do a lightweight pilot: pick two segments you\u2019re debating today, run fit estimation using your last 12\u201318 months of accounts, and show a comparison with driver breakdown and recommended ICP profile based on observed outcomes. If it doesn\u2019t resonate, you stop. If it does, you\u2019ve got something concrete to take back internally.",

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Fair critique. The differentiation is in the driver analysis and segment comparison. It\u2019s not just \u201crenewers.\u201d It\u2019s identifying what characteristics correlate with renewals and expansion\u2014like time-to-value under 30 days, certain operational pain points, or lower support burden. And it flags where you\u2019re winning deals that later churn, which is often the hidden cost.",

      "text": "This feature adds end-to-end regression coverage for the full `fit_estimation` pipeline\u2014from CSV import and normalization through to the scoring request and returned fit score plus driver breakdown. The goal is to catch failures that only surface when multiple components interact, especially around data type coercion, field mapping, and validation behavior.\n\nWe will introduce representative CSV fixtures that mirror real-world inputs and common edge cases: enums with unexpected casing/values, blanks, `NaN`, and out-of-range numbers. The tests will assert both the final outputs and the intermediate contract: specifically, that the normalized values produced by the import layer are exactly what the scoring service receives.\n\nA key impact is enforcing correct, structured error handling for invalid inputs. Rather than silently defaulting or degrading scores, invalid fields must produce explicit, per-field validation errors that are returned in a predictable shape, making issues actionable for users and safer for downstream scoring integrity.\n\nOperationally, this suite reduces regression risk and accelerates iteration by catching breaking changes early in CI, particularly across the recent fixes in GOLD-1 and the input validation changes in GOLD-2. It also establishes a durable baseline for future schema or scoring evolutions, ensuring CSV import remains reliable as the product expands.",

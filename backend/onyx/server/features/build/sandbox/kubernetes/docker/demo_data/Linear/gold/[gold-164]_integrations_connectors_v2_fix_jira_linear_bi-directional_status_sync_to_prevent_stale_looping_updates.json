Implement per-issue sync metadata (last_synced_state, last_synced_at, and origin) and update logic to ignore self-generated updates while still applying legitimate remote changes. Ensure transitions map correctly across systems and add targeted logs/metrics to surface dropped or conflicting updates.",

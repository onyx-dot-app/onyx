Add one-click presets for common regulated environments (e.g., \u201cRegulated/No AI Generation\u201d, \u201cPII-Restricted Comms Ingestion\u201d) with safe defaults to reduce implementation time. Ensure changes are validated client/server-side and display an explicit \u201cwhy blocked\u201d message when generation or ingestion is disabled by policy.",

Update the rule evaluation to consider upcoming meetings across synced sources (CRM events + calendar-linked meetings) and to ignore canceled/no-show events. Add a small set of unit/integration tests covering common edge cases (rescheduled meetings, timezones, and missing event IDs) to prevent regressions.",

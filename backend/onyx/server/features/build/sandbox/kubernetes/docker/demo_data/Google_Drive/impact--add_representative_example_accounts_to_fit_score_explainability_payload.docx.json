      "text": "This feature adds a small set of representative \u201cexample accounts\u201d to the Fit Score explainability payload so users can immediately see concrete, real accounts that exemplify each score band (e.g., high-, medium-, and low-fit) for the segment they just evaluated. Instead of only describing drivers and factors in the abstract, the explainability response will include account ID, account name, and Fit Score for a handful of curated examples per bucket.\n\nThe primary product impact is improved interpretability and trust. Showing \u201chere are accounts like the ones we mean\u201d makes the Fit Score easier to validate, reduces time-to-understanding for new users, and supports faster decision-making (e.g., sales targeting, segment refinement) by grounding explanations in recognizable entities.\n\nTo ensure the experience is stable and credible, selection must be deterministic and quality-weighted: examples should favor recent accounts with high data completeness, then choose within defined score buckets to ensure coverage across fit levels. This reduces noise between runs, avoids confusing churn in the examples list, and prevents low-signal segments from producing misleading outputs (with sensible empty states when there aren\u2019t enough qualifying accounts).\n\nFrom a rollout and integration standpoint, the API/SDK response must remain backward-compatible by adding optional fields rather than changing existing ones. Engineering impact includes implementing bucket logic, deterministic ordering, and unit tests that validate bucket selection behavior as well as handling for empty or sparse segments, so downstream consumers can rely on consistent results.",

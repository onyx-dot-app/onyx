I work with teams that are trying to get clearer on which customer segments are actually a great fit and then arm sales with messaging and objection handling that matches what\u2019s working in the real world.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Perfect. The reason I reached out is we\u2019ve been seeing a pattern with financial services orgs\u2014especially lenders and microfinance\u2014where the CRM and product data tells a very different story than the \u201cideal customer profile\u201d everyone thinks they have. Our product, Customer_Analyzer, pulls in signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, support tickets\u2014and computes a fit score by account and by segment, 0 to 100, with a driver breakdown of why it\u2019s high or low.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. BI usually tells you \u201cwhat happened.\u201d Customer_Analyzer is geared to answer \u201cwho should we pursue next and how should we talk to them.\u201d Two pieces are most relevant: first, fit estimation\u2014so you can define fit drivers like industry, size, problem severity, adoption patterns, support burden, churn signals\u2014and it returns a fit score plus the underlying drivers. Second, it compares segments\u2014like small community lenders vs larger institutions\u2014so you can see where retention, expansion, and conversion actually concentrate.",

      "text": "Beau Medina: We don\u2019t really sell to \u201csegments\u201d in a formal way. We\u2019re pretty relationship-driven. And honestly, we\u2019re not looking to add another tool right now.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/5686960-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. When I say segments, it can be as simple as \u201caccounts with shorter time-to-value\u201d or \u201caccounts with high support burden\u201d rather than a strict industry bucket. Where this tends to land quickly is sales enablement: we generate an objection-handling guide tied to your strongest value drivers for best-fit accounts. So instead of generic talk tracks, reps get \u201cWhen a prospect like X says Y, here are the proof points and differentiators that map to what our best customers actually care about.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s great\u2014what we usually see is battlecards are built from opinions and a few anecdotes. This ties them to observed outcomes. For example, if the driver breakdown shows that \u201cintegration complexity\u201d correlates with lower fit and higher churn risk, that becomes a clear qualification and objection strategy: when integration comes up, you either position your approach more precisely\u2014or you disqualify earlier and save cycles. On the flip side, if \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d and \u201cproblem severity\u201d are the strongest drivers for high-fit accounts, the messaging and proof points get tuned around that.",

      "text": "Beau Medina: I hear you, but we\u2019re a regulated environment. We\u2019re not going to pipe support tickets and usage data into a new SaaS without a long security review. That\u2019s a big lift.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Makes sense. A lot of teams start lighter: we can begin with CRM fields and onboarding survey data only\u2014whatever you\u2019re comfortable with\u2014and still produce an initial fit model. Then, if it\u2019s valuable, we expand inputs over time. The goal for the first pass is just to show, \u201cHere are the top fit drivers, here\u2019s how accounts stack rank, and here\u2019s what messaging is resonating with those high-fit groups.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Got it. In that case, I can keep this super scoped. The next step I\u2019d normally suggest is a 30-minute working session where we map your current \u201cbest customer\u201d definition to 6\u20138 fit drivers, and we\u2019d show you what outputs look like\u2014fit score, driver breakdown, and a draft objection-handling outline.

      "text": "Beau Medina: Yeah, I don\u2019t think I can commit to a working session. Also, I\u2019m not the buyer for this. Enablement sits with RevOps and our Head of Sales, and any tooling goes through IT.",

If I could get 20 minutes with the right owner, I can tailor it to Stonebridge specifically\u2014no heavy prep, just a conversation about where you\u2019re seeing friction: low conversion in certain deal types, longer cycles, churn pockets, that kind of thing.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s fair. To address that directly: the only thing we\u2019d need to validate early is whether you can export a basic account table with outcomes\u2014like stage progression or renewal\u2014and a handful of attributes. If that\u2019s not feasible during the migration, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to pursue now.",

      "text": "James Choi: Hi Audrey, good to connect again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to get sharper about which industries to prioritize next quarter, especially balancing retention with support load. I wanted to walk you through how Customer_Analyzer\u2019s fit estimation would handle that, and see if we can map it to a small pilot.",

    {
      "text": "Audrey Pierce: Hi James. Yes, that\u2019s still the priority. We\u2019ve got pressure to pick two or three verticals and stop being so broad, but we don\u2019t want to chase segments that churn or crush support.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally. So the core of what I\u2019d recommend we focus on is fit estimation\u2014basically a 0\u2013100 fit score at the account and segment level, with a driver breakdown that explains the \u201cwhy.\u201d For your use case, we\u2019d set fit drivers like retention signals, support burden, and any usage/adoption patterns you have, then compare segments\u2014like \u201cindustry A vs industry B\u201d\u2014to see which ones are most likely to renew and expand without creating a support tax.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Audrey Pierce: Okay. How do you actually calculate \u201csupport burden\u201d? Because we have tickets in Zendesk, but tagging is inconsistent, and a lot of what\u2019s painful is in notes, not in neat fields.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/8060839-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Great question. We can ingest ticket volume and metadata, and where tagging is inconsistent, we can still start with ticket count per account, ticket severity if you have it, time-to-first-response, reopen rate\u2014things that are typically more reliable. If you also have categories, we\u2019ll use them; if not, we can still get directional signals. Then the model shows you how much that driver is pulling the fit score down for certain segments.",

    {
      "text": "Audrey Pierce: \u201cDirectional\u201d is the part that worries me. We tried something similar internally and it devolved into arguments about whether the data is even trustworthy enough to make decisions. Our CRM fields are messy, and usage data is spotty because some customers don\u2019t fully instrument.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s fair\u2014and data quality is usually the make-or-break. What we do in Customer_Analyzer is surface missingness explicitly in the driver breakdown. So if a segment\u2019s fit score is being computed with limited usage signals, you\u2019ll see that confidence is lower and which fields are sparse. The goal isn\u2019t to pretend the data is perfect\u2014it\u2019s to help you see what\u2019s reliable enough to act on and what isn\u2019t.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Understood. Let me anchor this to a concrete workflow. Step one: we pull your last 12\u201318 months of customers, group by industry, and compute segment-level fit based on outcomes you care about\u2014retention and support burden. Step two: you get a comparison view: \u201cindustry segments ranked by fit,\u201d plus the driver breakdown. Step three: we generate a recommended ICP profile based on observed outcomes\u2014basically what patterns correlate with renewals and low support load. That becomes the artifact you take to leadership.",

      "text": "Audrey Pierce: That sounds nice in theory, but we don\u2019t have clean \u201cindustry.\u201d We have like 30% blank, and the rest is free text, so \u201cMedia\u201d and \u201cEntertainment\u201d and \u201cBroadcast\u201d are all different. We\u2019ve been trying to fix it and it\u2019s slow.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Got it. If industry is noisy, we can still do segmenting by other firmographic proxies\u2014company size, region, revenue band\u2014whatever is more consistent. Or we can normalize the industry field, but I\u2019m not going to pretend that\u2019s zero effort. The fit estimation works best when at least a couple of key drivers are reasonably complete.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: I appreciate the honesty. The way we usually de-risk that is a tight pilot with a limited scope\u2014one or two data sources. For example, we could start with retention outcomes plus Zendesk ticket volume and a couple of firmographic fields you trust. Then, even if usage events are incomplete, you\u2019ll still get a segment ranking that\u2019s tied to real outcomes.",

Customer_Analyzer is flexible on what you treat as \u201csuccess.\u201d The key is choosing one definition for the pilot so the fit score is consistent.",

      "text": "Audrey Pierce: Okay, but I\u2019m still stuck on how credible the scoring is if our fields are incomplete. Last time you showed examples with crisp driver inputs like \u201cproblem severity\u201d and \u201ctime-to-value.\u201d We don\u2019t track those reliably.",

In your case, the most actionable drivers for industry prioritization are: retention/NRR outcomes, support burden, and a couple of firmographics. Then we can layer in adoption later if your instrumentation improves. The model will show you \u201chere\u2019s what\u2019s contributing\u201d and \u201chere\u2019s what\u2019s missing,\u201d so you\u2019re not guessing.",

You can see, for example, that \u201cindustry X looks good overall, but only for mid-market accounts,\u201d or \u201ctickets are high, but only during onboarding,\u201d which points you to what to fix versus what to avoid.

We\u2019re in budget season, and we\u2019re also evaluating a couple of tools that are closer to execution\u2014like routing and outbound automation. Those have clearer ROI for us right now.

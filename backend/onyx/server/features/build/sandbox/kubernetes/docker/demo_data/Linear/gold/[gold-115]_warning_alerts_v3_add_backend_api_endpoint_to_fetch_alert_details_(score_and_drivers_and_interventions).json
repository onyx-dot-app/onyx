Define and enforce a stable response schema with pagination/filtering (risk type, score/confidence, top drivers w/ evidence, interventions w/ rationale) and consistent null/missing-field handling across Salesforce/HubSpot. Add integration tests to ensure deterministic ordering and schema compatibility for downstream UI rendering.",

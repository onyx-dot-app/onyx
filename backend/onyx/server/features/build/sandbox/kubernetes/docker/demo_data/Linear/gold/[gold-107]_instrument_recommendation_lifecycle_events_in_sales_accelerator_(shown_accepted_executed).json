Use the canonical event schema from GOLD-106 and ensure each event includes a stable recommendation_instance_id plus required context (segment, rep, motion, account/opportunity, CRM IDs, timestamp). Add basic retry/batching and logging so dropped/invalid events can be detected without blocking core workflows.",

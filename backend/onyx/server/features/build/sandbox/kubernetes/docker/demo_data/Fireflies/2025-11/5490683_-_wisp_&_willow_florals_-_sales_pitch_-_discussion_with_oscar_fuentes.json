      "text": "Megan Foster: Great question. We don\u2019t replace either. Issue_Tracker sits between them and standardizes what we call an \u201cissue object\u201d\u2014a theme or root cause, with evidence attached from the original conversations, plus who\u2019s impacted and what it\u2019s costing you. Instead of 40 tickets that feel similar, it clusters them into one issue, shows the trend velocity, and keeps it linked to the Jira work you create.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Practically, it continuously ingests from Zendesk or Intercom, groups similar reports into clusters, and then gives you a clean view of \u201cthese are the top recurring problems.\u201d The part customers tend to like is the evidence panel: for any cluster, your engineering manager can click in and see representative examples, platform or device breakdowns, and whether the volume is rising week over week\u2014before committing someone to an on-call fix.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. And the second piece\u2014where teams see impact fast\u2014is issue prioritization. Issue_Tracker ranks each cluster with an explainable score based on things you configure: frequency and velocity, severity tags, customer tier or ARR, churn-risk flags, and segment importance. So instead of \u201csupport says it\u2019s urgent\u201d versus \u201cproduct says later,\u201d you have a shared, defensible logic for what to fix next.",

The score breaks down the \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014for example: \u201cHigh velocity + affecting top-tier customers + churn-risk flagged.\u201d And you can have different views by team. Support can look at SLA risk, product can view impact versus effort, and execs can see revenue exposure. It\u2019s the same underlying issues\u2014just framed for what each group needs.",

Then we map a few simple fields\u2014like customer tier, segment, or churn-risk\u2014either from your CRM or whatever source you already use. You can begin with very basic weighting, then refine as you see what\u2019s working. The goal is value in days, not months.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s common. Two ways teams handle it: first, you can start with what you do have\u2014severity tags, frequency, velocity\u2014so you still get clustering and a prioritized list. Second, as you connect CRM context, the system gets smarter about impact. Even partial data helps because it\u2019s about directional prioritization: which issues are both widespread and business-critical.",

Today it\u2019s scattered across tickets, maybe a few chats, and someone pings engineering with screenshots. With Issue_Tracker, those get clustered into one issue automatically, with trend velocity showing the spike, and evidence showing common patterns\u2014like it\u2019s happening mostly on mobile Safari, or only for certain order types. Your engineering manager can validate \u201cthis is real and widespread\u201d in minutes rather than chasing anecdotes.",

If it\u2019s low volume and low impact, it doesn\u2019t dominate the queue just because it\u2019s loud.",

So when support asks \u201cwhat do I tell this customer,\u201d they\u2019re not guessing or DM\u2019ing engineers. They can see: \u201cKnown issue, fix in progress, linked ticket ABC-123,\u201d and even pull the most relevant context.",

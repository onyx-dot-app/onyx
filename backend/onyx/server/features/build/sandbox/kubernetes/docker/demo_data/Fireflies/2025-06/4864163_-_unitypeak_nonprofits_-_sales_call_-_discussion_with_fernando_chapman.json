      "text": "Megan Foster: Hi Fernando, thanks for making the time again. Last time you mentioned Unitypeak\u2019s biggest pain is the end-of-month \u201csurprise\u201d on pipeline\u2014things look fine in the CRM and then three deals slip at once. I wanted to focus today on one piece of Sales_Accelerator that directly targets that: our sales_forecast view and the drivers behind it. Does that still feel like the priority?",

      "text": "Fernando Chapman: Yeah, forecast accuracy is still a priority. But I\u2019m also cautious\u2014our CRM data isn\u2019t always perfect, and I don\u2019t want another dashboard that\u2019s only as good as what people remember to enter.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair, and that\u2019s actually the right lens for this. Sales_Accelerator sits on top of your CRM, so we don\u2019t try to replace Salesforce discipline\u2014we surface where the discipline is breaking the forecast. The difference from a standard CRM forecast is we combine stage with activity signals\u2014email/call/meeting patterns\u2014and cycle-time benchmarks, and we can optionally use Customer_Analyzer\u2019s fit score as a weighting factor. So if a deal is \u201clate\u201d for the stage and hasn\u2019t had a meaningful touch, it drops out of commit even if it\u2019s still marked \u201cverbal yes.\u201d",

And honestly, our stages are inconsistent across teams\u2014some folks skip stages, some don\u2019t update close dates until the last second.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Understood. Let me anchor on how it\u2019s explainable so it\u2019s not a black box. For any forecast number\u2014commit, best-case, pipeline\u2014you can click into the drivers: stage age, last touch, whether a next meeting is scheduled, fit tier if you bring in Customer_Analyzer, and historical win rate for similar deals. Then you can see \u201cwhy\u201d it\u2019s at risk, not just \u201cit\u2019s at risk.\u201d It\u2019s less \u201calerts everywhere\u201d and more \u201cthese five deals are the reason your commit is inflated.\u201d",

      "text": "Megan Foster: You\u2019re right that hygiene matters. Where teams see traction quickly is using the system to *highlight* hygiene problems in a way that\u2019s tied to outcomes. For example, Sales ops can view stage slippage diagnostics and conversion by segment and rep. If one segment shows a big drop from discovery to evaluation, we can recommend a process fix\u2014like moving security review earlier\u2014and then monitor whether conversion improves. The tool becomes a feedback loop, not just a report.",

We base them on *your* historical cycle times and win rates by whatever breakdown is meaningful\u2014source, motion, rep, or even \u201cgrant-funded vs. donor-led.\u201d The system learns patterns from your own pipeline history. And on top of that, the scenario planning can help you quantify what you need\u2014like \u201cIf we add 20 SQLs in the highest-fit tier, what\u2019s the expected impact this quarter?\u201d That\u2019s especially useful for planning around board expectations.",

It\u2019s not perfect, but it reduces reliance on manual entry. And we can set thresholds so it\u2019s not pinging people for minor things\u2014more like \u201cno touch in 14 days on a late-stage deal\u201d rather than \u201cyou didn\u2019t send an email today.\u201d",

      "text": "Megan Foster: True. One practical approach we\u2019ve seen: start with a narrow scope\u2014one team, one motion\u2014and use the stage conversion report to *expose* inconsistencies. If Team A has 40% conversion to proposal and Team B has 10%, either they\u2019re doing something different or their stage definitions differ. Sales ops can then standardize. The forecast then becomes a forcing function to clean things up because leadership starts trusting it and asks for it.",

If we can get agreement on scope, I can propose a phased plan: start with forecasting for one pipeline slice and prove improved accuracy and fewer slips.

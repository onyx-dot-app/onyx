If the target record is in an `alignment_failed` state (from the existing sync check) or no approved blocks exist for the expected version, prevent generating a draft and return a structured \u201cblocked\u201d response for the UI to handle. Ensure the enforcement applies consistently across initiation and follow-up draft endpoints.",

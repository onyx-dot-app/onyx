      "text": "### Fit Driver Selection Wizard with Recommended Defaults \u2014 Brief Design\n\nWe will add a guided \u201cFit Driver Selection\u201d step to the workspace setup flow that recommends an initial set of fit drivers based on the workspace\u2019s connected data sources (e.g., CRM fields, survey responses, product usage events, and support tickets). The goal is to reduce time-to-value by pre-populating a sensible default configuration while still letting users control which drivers are used for fit scoring.\n\nOn entry to the step, the backend will compute a recommendation set by inspecting available signals and mapping them to our canonical driver taxonomy (e.g., \u201cUsage frequency\u201d from product events, \u201cPlan tier\u201d from CRM, \u201cNPS/CSAT\u201d from surveys, \u201cTicket volume/severity\u201d from support). Each recommended driver will include a short explanation (\u201cRecommended because we found X in Y\u201d) and a confidence/strength indicator used only for ordering. The UI will present a list of recommended drivers (checked by default), allow add/remove from the broader driver catalog, and include an \u201cAccept all\u201d action that selects all recommended items and proceeds.\n\nWhen the user continues, we will persist the selected driver set and any default parameters (e.g., which field/event powers a driver, aggregation window, thresholds) to the workspace configuration so downstream fit scoring runs against exactly the same configuration. This configuration should be versioned (or at least timestamped) to support auditing and future migration, and setup completion should be unblocked even if no sources are connected (in which case we fall back to a small generic default set and explain the limitation).\n\nImplementation-wise, we\u2019ll introduce a recommendation service (or module) that takes `workspace_id` and returns `recommendedDrivers[]` with metadata (driver key, source mapping, rationale, suggested defaults). The setup flow will call this endpoint, render the wizard state client-side, then save via a single \u201cupsert workspace fit config\u201d API that stores: selected drivers, per-driver source bindings, and default parameters. We\u2019ll instrument key events (view step, accept all, add/remove, save) to measure adoption and iterate on recommendation quality.",

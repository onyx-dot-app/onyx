    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Perfect. Then I\u2019d focus us on Customer_Analyzer\u2019s fit_estimation\u2014because it directly answers \u201cwho\u2019s most likely to succeed with us and why,\u201d and it\u2019s very actionable for roadmap bets. Before I walk through it, what data sources do you have that could signal success today\u2014CRM fields, product usage, support tickets, surveys?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: That\u2019s a common mix. The way fit_estimation works is: you define a small set of fit drivers\u2014say industry, size, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, and churn risk signals\u2014and we compute a fit score from 0\u2013100 at the account level, then roll it up to segment-level views. The key output for product planning is the driver breakdown. It shows why a segment scores high or low\u2014so you can connect \u201cthis segment retains and expands\u201d to \u201cthese needs are actually being met.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Tatum Green: When you say \u201csegment,\u201d how flexible is that? Because one issue we run into is overlapping segment definitions. Like, industries overlap with personas, and then size buckets overlap with use cases.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Great callout\u2014and it\u2019s one of the places teams can get tripped up if they don\u2019t set guardrails. In Customer_Analyzer, segments can be built on multiple attributes, but we recommend starting with a simple segmentation model: one primary dimension at a time, like \u201cindustry + size,\u201d then layer persona as a secondary cut only after you\u2019ve validated the baseline. The product helps by showing segment comparisons side-by-side\u2014SMB vs mid-market, or healthcare vs financial services\u2014and it flags when segments are too small or too overlapping to draw strong conclusions.",

      "text": "Tatum Green: Okay. My worry is we\u2019ll end up with confusing recommendations if the segments aren\u2019t clean. We\u2019ve had analytics tools do that\u2014lots of charts, not a lot of clarity.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6468361-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Totally fair. The way we avoid \u201cchart overload\u201d is by forcing the output into two decisions: (1) what\u2019s your recommended ICP profile based on observed outcomes, and (2) what are the top fit drivers that explain it. So instead of giving you 30 slices, it highlights \u201cthese 2\u20133 segments are outperforming, and here\u2019s the evidence.\u201d Then for product planning, you can ask: \u201cWhat unmet needs exist in the high-fit segments?\u201d and prioritize roadmap items that increase adoption or reduce support burden for those segments.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Typical time-to-value is a couple weeks for a strong first pass. If you can connect CRM plus product usage, we can produce an initial fit model quickly\u2014then refine it. We usually start with a workshop where you pick 5\u20137 fit drivers. For example: firmographics (industry, size), time-to-value (how quickly do they reach activation), adoption depth (feature usage frequency), support burden (ticket volume/severity), and churn risk indicators.

      "text": "Irene Shen: If support data is noisy, we can downweight it initially or use simpler proxies\u2014like \u201ctickets per active user\u201d or tagged categories you trust. The fit model isn\u2019t \u201call or nothing.\u201d You can start with higher-confidence drivers\u2014usage and retention signals\u2014and then add support signals once you\u2019ve cleaned up tags or standardized categories.

In your roadmap meeting, you\u2019d pull up: \u201cSegment A has a fit score of 82 with strong retention and expansion; Segment B has 61 with longer time-to-value and higher support burden.\u201d Then you can dig into why\u2014maybe Segment B struggles with onboarding steps or a specific workflow. That tells product: \u201cIf we want Segment B, we need these improvements,\u201d or \u201cIf we want to win faster, double down on Segment A\u2019s unmet needs.\u201d It turns the roadmap debate from opinion into evidence tied to outcomes.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Ava\u2014Mina Park here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll be brief. I work with teams who are trying to get sharper on which customer segments are actually the best fit, and then turning that into messaging that helps win more deals. Does that match anything you\u2019re focused on at Lucid Grove Studios right now?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great question. Dashboards show activity; they don\u2019t usually answer \u201cwho is most likely to buy, succeed, renew, and expand\u201d in a consistent, comparable way. The key feature is fit_estimation: you define fit drivers\u2014industry, size, problem severity, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, churn-risk signals\u2014and we compute a 0\u2013100 fit score at the account and segment level, with a driver breakdown. So instead of debating \u201chealthcare feels good,\u201d you can see \u201chealthcare is 82 because retention is high and support burden is low; agencies are 55 because time-to-value is slower and churn risk is higher.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s actually when this helps most\u2014when the segments are messy and the team is operating on anecdotes. One common use case is prioritizing which industries to target next quarter using retention and support burden signals. For example, if one industry keeps renewing but generates heavy support load, it might not be the best segment to scale. Or the opposite: a smaller segment might look quiet in volume but has great retention, fast adoption, and low support burden\u2014meaning you can grow it profitably.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s very normal. We don\u2019t require perfection to start. The model can begin with whatever you trust\u2014say CRM firmographics and basic retention\u2014and then layer in other signals as you connect them. Even with partial data, the output is still useful because it forces a consistent definition of fit drivers and shows the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the score. And if a driver is missing or low confidence, it\u2019s flagged rather than silently skewing results.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. My goal today isn\u2019t to sell you on a big rollout\u2014just to see if it\u2019s worth a deeper look. Typically the first step is a short working session where we map 5\u20137 fit drivers you already agree on, then we run a quick segment comparison\u2014like SMB vs mid-market, or industry A vs industry B\u2014based on retention and support burden. That usually takes a couple weeks end-to-end, and the output is a recommended ICP profile and a segment ranking you can actually use in planning.",

Even if you don\u2019t change the target, it can influence positioning\u2014what proof points to lead with, which objections to preempt, and what \u201cgood fit\u201d looks like for qualification.",

Then let me keep it very concrete: if you could press a button and see a ranked list of your customer segments with (1) a fit score, and (2) the top three drivers\u2014retention, support burden, time-to-value\u2014would that be useful for planning?

      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Noel, this is Mina Park\u2014thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll keep this brief. I\u2019m calling because teams like yours at Everglow Summit Research often have a ton of customer data\u2014CRM fields, onboarding notes, support tickets, usage\u2014but it\u2019s hard to turn that into a clear answer on \u201cwho are our best customers\u201d and \u201cwhich industries should we prioritize next quarter.\u201d Does that sound like a live question on your side?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Noel Barrett: Yeah, it does. We\u2019ve been debating which segments to lean into, and everyone has an opinion. We have data, but it\u2019s scattered.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6419750-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly. That\u2019s the problem Customer_Analyzer is built for. It ingests those signals\u2014your CRM, onboarding survey responses, product usage patterns, support burden\u2014and produces two practical outputs. The main one I want to highlight is our fit estimation: a fit score from 0 to 100 at the account and segment level, plus a driver breakdown that explains why a segment is high or low fit.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Noel Barrett: Fit score sounds interesting, but we\u2019ve tried scoring models before. They\u2019re usually a black box or they don\u2019t match reality.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6419750-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. The way we avoid the black-box issue is that you define\u2014or select\u2014your fit drivers up front. For example: industry and size, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, churn risk signals, even willingness-to-pay proxies. Then the score is accompanied by a clear breakdown: \u201cHere are the drivers pushing this segment up; here are the drivers dragging it down.\u201d So when someone asks \u201cWhy are mid-market biotech customers scoring higher than SMB fintech?\u201d you can answer it with evidence, not intuition.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6419750-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Noel Barrett: Okay. How does it help with next quarter planning specifically? We\u2019re trying to decide which industries to target, but we also don\u2019t want to overload support.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6419750-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s a perfect use case. A lot of teams optimize for pipeline alone and then get burned by retention or support burden. With Customer_Analyzer, you can compare segments using retention outcomes and support signals side-by-side. So you can see, for instance: \u201cThis industry converts fast, but has heavy ticket volume and higher churn risk\u201d versus \u201cThis other industry has slightly slower conversion, but sticks longer and expands.\u201d The fit estimation gives you a segment comparison view, so next-quarter targeting becomes a prioritization exercise grounded in retention and support reality.",

    {
      "text": "Noel Barrett: That would be useful. We currently look at retention in one dashboard and support in another, and marketing doesn\u2019t always buy into what product is seeing.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Right\u2014and the big value is alignment. Because the output is shared and explainable, marketing, sales, and product can all look at the same segment-level fit story. It also recommends an ICP profile based on observed outcomes like retention, expansion, and conversion\u2014so it\u2019s not just \u201cwhat we think,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s actually working.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: We try to keep the initial lift light. For a first pass, we usually start with the signals you already trust: Salesforce fields for firmographics and pipeline, Zendesk for support burden, and a few key product usage events that correlate with adoption. You don\u2019t need a perfect data warehouse on day one. The goal of an initial rollout is to produce a credible segment comparison and a first ICP recommendation quickly\u2014then you can refine drivers as you learn.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Usually a partnership. RevOps or analytics helps with the data connections, then product marketing and sales leadership use the outputs to make decisions. The reason it works is the outputs are designed to be operational: fit score, driver breakdown, and segment comparisons that plug into targeting, messaging, and account prioritization.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great question. For a meaningful evaluation, we\u2019d want: your current segment definitions\u2014or how you think about industries and company sizes\u2014plus a couple outcome metrics you care about, like retention at 6\u201312 months and a measure of support burden, like tickets per account. Then we map a few candidate fit drivers and run the segment comparison. In a follow-up session, we\u2019d walk through: which segments look strongest, what\u2019s driving it, and where the tradeoffs are.",

    {
      "text": "Noel Barrett: That sounds reasonable. I\u2019m curious\u2014how do you handle cases where a segment is high retention but low growth potential, or vice versa?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: We don\u2019t force one \u201cbest\u201d answer. The fit score is one input, and the driver view makes the tradeoffs explicit. You can weight drivers differently depending on your goal for the quarter\u2014growth vs efficiency, for example. So if next quarter is about expanding responsibly, you might weight retention and support burden more. If it\u2019s about breaking into a new market, you might incorporate willingness-to-pay proxies and time-to-value more heavily. The key is the model stays transparent.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly the idea. Rather than debating anecdotes, you\u2019re debating weights and evidence\u2014and that\u2019s a much healthier conversation. If you\u2019re open to it, the next step would be a 30\u201345 minute working session where I can show you what the fit estimation and segment comparisons look like, and we can map your current targeting questions to the drivers.",

I\u2019ll send a calendar invite with a short checklist: the segments you\u2019re considering, the retention metric you use, and whichever support burden metric you trust most.

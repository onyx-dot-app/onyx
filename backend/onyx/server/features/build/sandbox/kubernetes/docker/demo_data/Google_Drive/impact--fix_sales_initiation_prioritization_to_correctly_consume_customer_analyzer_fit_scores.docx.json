      "text": "This change ensures Sales Initiation recommendations are prioritized using the correct Customer_Analyzer fit scores, fixing cases where accounts appear in an incorrect order in the MVP rule-based list. By reliably applying fit scores, the list better reflects our intended \u201cbest next accounts\u201d ranking and reduces confusion for reps when recommendations don\u2019t match expected account quality.\n\nWe will update the prioritization logic to fetch and apply the latest fit score per account, so rankings stay current as Customer_Analyzer scores refresh. When a fit score is missing, the system will fall back gracefully (rather than mis-ranking or failing), preserving a stable and predictable ordering for accounts without scores.\n\nThe primary user impact is improved trust and efficiency: reps spend less time second-guessing the recommendation list, and sales teams are more likely to act on the top-ranked accounts because the ordering aligns with our fit model. Downstream, this should improve conversion on initiated outreach by concentrating attention on higher-fit accounts first.\n\nTo prevent future ranking drift, we will add a minimal regression test that covers both \u201cscore present\u201d and \u201cscore missing\u201d scenarios. This provides a safeguard against subtle logic changes that could reintroduce incorrect ordering, and helps maintain consistency as we iterate on recommendation rules and scoring inputs.",

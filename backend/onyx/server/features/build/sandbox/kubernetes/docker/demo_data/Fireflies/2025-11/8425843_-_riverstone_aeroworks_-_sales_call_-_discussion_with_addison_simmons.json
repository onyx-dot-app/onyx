      "text": "Megan Foster: Hi Addison\u2014thanks again for making time. Last time you mentioned Riverstone Aeroworks is looking for something that helps the team act on pipeline insights, not just report on them. I wanted to focus today on Sales_Accelerator\u2014specifically the forecasting layer and the \u201cwhat to do next\u201d guidance\u2014so we can see if it\u2019s something you\u2019d actually roll out this quarter. Does that still match what you\u2019re trying to solve?",

    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: Hi Megan. Yes, broadly. We\u2019re definitely feeling pain around forecast reliability and end-of-quarter surprises. I\u2019m open to hearing how you think you\u2019d help, but I\u2019m also cautious\u2014our CRM data isn\u2019t pristine.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s helpful context, and I\u2019m glad you called that out. The piece that generated interest last time was our sales_forecast capability\u2014because it doesn\u2019t just take CRM stage at face value. It blends stage + activity signals like recent emails/calls/meetings, stage age, whether there\u2019s a next meeting scheduled, and optionally fit-tier weighting from Customer_Analyzer. The point is: it\u2019s explainable and it flags why a deal is in commit versus best-case, so you can coach and correct early. How are you forecasting today\u2014spreadsheet rollups, manager judgment, CRM reports?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: A mix. CRM reports and then a lot of manager judgment. The issue is reps don\u2019t always update close dates or next steps, and activities live in different tools. So forecasting becomes a debate, not a system.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Understood. Two quick angles that tend to resonate for sales ops: first, pipeline forecasting that\u2019s grounded in behavior\u2014like \u201cno customer touch in 14 days\u201d or \u201cstage age is double the benchmark,\u201d which is often more predictive than a rep\u2019s confidence. Second, bottleneck diagnostics\u2014seeing stage-to-stage conversion by segment and rep, and where deals are stalling. In your world, do you have a consistent \u201cstuck\u201d stage? Like moving from discovery to evaluation, or evaluation to procurement?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: Discovery to evaluation is messy. We also get hung up on security and compliance late, which causes slips. But I\u2019m not sure a tool can fix the underlying process. And again\u2014if stages are stale, the system will just shout at us constantly.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair. On the bottleneck side, what we do is show conversion and slippage by stage, segment, and rep, and then recommend process adjustments\u2014like pulling a security step earlier if that\u2019s consistently the source of late-cycle slips. It\u2019s not magic, but it makes the bottleneck visible and measurable. On the \u201cshouting constantly\u201d concern\u2014alert fatigue is real. We tune risk signals so they\u2019re tied to a few high-confidence drivers: stage age relative to your historical cycle time, last touch, and whether there\u2019s a scheduled next meeting. And we can start with a limited set of alerts rather than everything at once.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-7"
    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: Okay, but that tuning requires good baselines. We don\u2019t have clean historical cycle-time benchmarks across teams. Different reps run different processes, and our segments aren\u2019t consistently tagged. I\u2019m worried we\u2019d spend months cleaning data just to get basic value.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s a key question: time-to-value. In most deployments, we start by using what you already have\u2014stages, close dates, and activity metadata\u2014and we layer in benchmarks gradually. Even if the historical data is imperfect, stage age plus \u201cnext meeting scheduled\u201d and recency of customer engagement can still give you a meaningful risk view. And if you\u2019re already using Customer_Analyzer, we can use those fit tiers as a weighting factor to make the forecast more realistic\u2014so your Tier 1 ICP deals get treated differently than lower-fit pipeline.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: We are using Customer_Analyzer, yes, but our team doesn\u2019t always agree with the fit scores. Some AEs think the model is missing nuance, and they sometimes override it informally. If Sales_Accelerator depends on those scores, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be trusted.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: It doesn\u2019t have to depend on them\u2014it can optionally use fit as one driver. The forecast remains explainable, so if a deal is being down-weighted due to low fit, that\u2019s visible, and you can decide whether to include that driver. The bigger benefit I\u2019d emphasize is consistency: instead of every manager using a different mental model, you get one system showing commit/best-case/pipeline with clear reasons. That usually reduces the \u201cforecast meeting as argument\u201d dynamic.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: Consistency is appealing, but we\u2019ve tried \u201cone system\u201d before. The reps see it as management oversight. Adoption becomes the issue, not the tooling. Also, we\u2019re on HubSpot plus a couple of email tools\u2014integrations have been painful historically.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-12"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s fair. Sales_Accelerator is designed to sit on top of your CRM rather than replace it, and we integrate to pull activity signals. But adoption-wise, we try to make it useful to reps, not just leaders\u2014like showing a rep which deals are likely to slip and what action could reduce that risk, for example \u201cschedule next meeting,\u201d \u201creconfirm decision criteria,\u201d or \u201cpull in security earlier.\u201d The idea is it helps them hit their number, not just get inspected. Do you think your reps would engage if it clearly helped them protect deals at risk?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: Some would. Others would ignore it. And I\u2019m still stuck on the inputs. If reps aren\u2019t logging next steps reliably, you\u2019ll mark everything risky and people will just tune it out. We already have dashboards that people ignore because they don\u2019t reflect reality.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-14"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Makes sense. One approach is to start with a narrow pilot: one segment or one team, and focus on a couple of signals that are hard to fake\u2014like email/calendar activity and last customer touch\u2014so it\u2019s not purely dependent on manual CRM hygiene. Then we add stage hygiene improvements as a parallel initiative. We\u2019ve seen teams get value even before perfect hygiene, because the tool surfaces \u201csilent deals\u201d you didn\u2019t realize were going dark.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-15"
    },
    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: Maybe. But candidly, we have limited bandwidth for parallel initiatives. Our ops team is slammed. If this requires process redesign plus data cleanup plus configuration, it\u2019s going to lose out to other priorities.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/3195382-16"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: If bandwidth is the constraint, we can keep the pilot extremely scoped: forecasting at the pipeline level with just the explainable drivers and a light set of slippage diagnostics. The sales ops use case you mentioned\u2014pinpointing bottlenecks\u2014could be a quick win without a giant change program. For example, we could show \u201cevaluation \u2192 security\u201d conversion and time-in-stage, and test whether moving security earlier reduces slippage over a month.",

    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: A month isn\u2019t realistic for us to see improvement. Our cycles are longer. And we\u2019ve been burned by pilots that don\u2019t translate into adoption. Leadership then asks why we spent money at all.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Understood. Let\u2019s talk about what \u201cbuying stage\u201d would look like on your side. If you were to move forward, what decision criteria would you need? Is it forecast accuracy improvement, reduction in slips, manager adoption, rep adoption, or integration effort?",

      "text": "Addison Simmons: Integration effort and ongoing maintenance are huge. We don\u2019t want another tool that needs constant babysitting. And yes\u2014forecast accuracy, but we\u2019d need to prove it. Our CFO is skeptical of new forecasting tools because the core issue is human behavior and messy data.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s a reasonable CFO perspective. What I can do is propose a structured evaluation: we take a snapshot of your current pipeline, run Sales_Accelerator forecasting in parallel with your existing method for a few weeks, and compare. Because the forecast is driver-based, we can also show where the misses come from\u2014like stale close dates, lack of next meeting, stage age outliers\u2014so it doubles as a hygiene map. Would that be something you\u2019d be willing to set up if we keep implementation light?",

    {
      "text": "Addison Simmons: I\u2019m hesitant. We\u2019ve done \u201cparallel runs\u201d before and the outputs become a distraction. Also, if the tool is going to tell us \u201cyour CRM is messy,\u201d we already know that. The question is whether it meaningfully improves outcomes without us rebuilding our entire process.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s fair. If we strip it down: the two concrete outcomes we aim for are fewer end-of-quarter surprises\u2014because risky deals are flagged earlier with clear reasons\u2014and faster identification of pipeline bottlenecks\u2014so ops can target a process fix instead of guessing. But if your team can\u2019t act on the signals due to bandwidth, then you won\u2019t get that value.",

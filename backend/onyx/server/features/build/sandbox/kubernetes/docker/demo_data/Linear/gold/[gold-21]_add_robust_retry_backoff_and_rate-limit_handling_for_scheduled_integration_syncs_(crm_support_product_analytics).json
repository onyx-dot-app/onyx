Implement a shared retry policy that respects provider rate-limit headers (e.g., Retry-After), uses exponential backoff with jitter, and caps retries per run to avoid endless execution. Ensure failures are surfaced as a terminal run status (to leverage existing observability) so the system can safely resume on the next scheduled run without partial writes.",

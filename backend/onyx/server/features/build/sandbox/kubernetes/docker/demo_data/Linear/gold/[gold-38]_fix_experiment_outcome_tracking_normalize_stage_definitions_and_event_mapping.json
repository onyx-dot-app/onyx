      "text": "Outcome tracking for messaging experiments is producing inconsistent win rate, pipeline velocity, and conversion metrics due to mismatched stage names and event mappings across CRM and product events. Add a single normalization layer that maps source-specific stages/events to canonical funnel stages used by the experiment analytics. Ensure the mapping is applied consistently across ingestion and query paths so the same experiment yields stable metrics regardless of source variations.",

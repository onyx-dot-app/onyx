      "text": "This feature adds a backend evaluator that continuously monitors customer- and segment-level signals and determines when alert trigger conditions are met\u2014specifically fit drift, segment composition changes, and emerging high\u2011fit cohorts. On a scheduled cadence, the service will compute the required metrics from available signal data and compare them to the trigger definitions and thresholds specified in GOLD-40, enabling proactive detection rather than manual analysis.\n\nWhen a trigger fires, the evaluator will emit a normalized \u201calert event\u201d containing consistent fields (alert type, target entity such as customer/segment/cohort, timestamp, computed metrics, and the threshold values that were crossed). These events will be persisted in a durable store so downstream systems (notification delivery, integrations, and the UI) can reliably query, render, and route alerts without re-running expensive evaluations.\n\nTo ensure alert quality and reduce noise, the service will include idempotency and deduplication so the same underlying condition within a configured window does not generate repeated alerts. This directly improves user trust in alerting, prevents notification fatigue, and simplifies downstream delivery logic by providing a clean event stream.\n\nThe evaluator will also handle missing or low-volume data according to the spec (e.g., suppressing alerts, degrading gracefully, and/or annotating events with data-quality context). This reduces false positives in sparse segments, keeps alerting stable during data gaps, and provides predictable behavior across customers with varying traffic and signal maturity.",

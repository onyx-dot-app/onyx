      "text": "Megan Foster: Hi Drew\u2014good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re trying to tighten up who you go after and then tailor messaging for SMB versus mid-market. I wanted to focus today on how Customer_Analyzer\u2019s positioning recommendations can help you get to shippable landing page and outbound copy, and what it would take to roll it out at Xylembright. Sound good?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Drew Cox: Yep, that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re stuck. We\u2019ve got interest coming in from a few directions, but we\u2019re not confident our ICP definition is crisp, and the messaging is a little \u201cone size fits all.\u201d",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Makes sense. Quick recap on what we\u2019d implement: Customer_Analyzer ingests your signals\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and then it outputs two things. One is a fit score by segment, and the other is positioning recommendations that turn the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the fit into actual messaging blocks your team can use.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Drew Cox: The messaging blocks part is what caught my attention. We\u2019ve done internal workshops, but translating them into copy and sales talk tracks takes forever.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. For your use case\u2014two ICP tiers, SMB vs mid-market\u2014the positioning_recommendation feature generates segment-specific value props, top use cases, differentiators, proof points to collect, plus pricing/value framing notes and an objection-handling playbook. Then it formats that into editable blocks like: website hero copy, three bullets for a sales deck, and email openers for outbound.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Drew Cox: Okay. How \u201creal\u201d are those recommendations? Like, is it generic AI copy, or is it grounded in our customer language?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Grounded. The recommendations are linked back to the underlying drivers and evidence\u2014so if it says \u201cmid-market buyers care about compliance reporting and audit trails,\u201d you can click into the support ticket themes, the CRM notes, or the onboarding responses that drove that. And it\u2019ll pull phrasing that customers actually used so you can mirror their language instead of inventing it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-7"
    },
    {
      "text": "Drew Cox: That\u2019s helpful. One concern I have is our segment definitions are kind of messy. We have overlap between industries\u2014municipal, industrial, commercial\u2014and personas\u2014ops, procurement, sustainability. I don\u2019t want to feed in a bunch of ambiguity and get confusing recommendations back.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s a very real risk, and it\u2019s one of the few ways teams get \u201cmeh\u201d output. The good news is we can handle it in a structured way. What we typically do is start with just two clean cuts for the first pass\u2014SMB vs mid-market\u2014using objective fields you already trust, like employee count, annual revenue, contract value, or deal size. Then we add a second layer like \u201cindustry\u201d only if it\u2019s predictive.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-9"

    {
      "text": "Drew Cox: But what if the industry is predictive and persona is predictive? That\u2019s what we suspect.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Then we don\u2019t try to boil the ocean in week one. We\u2019ll start by validating which dimension drives fit the most. Customer_Analyzer will show you the top fit drivers by segment and also where the overlap is creating noise. If \u201cmunicipal + procurement\u201d and \u201cindustrial + ops\u201d behave differently, we can split them\u2014just not before we have evidence. The key is: we\u2019ll keep the initial segmentation simple enough to produce clean recommendations, then iterate.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/6255910-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Drew Cox: Got it. Another question: we need this to actually produce usable landing page copy for each tier. Our marketing team is small, and sales is pushing for more targeted outbound. Can you walk me through what the output looks like?",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Sure. For SMB, you\u2019d typically see a value proposition that\u2019s shorter and more outcomes-based\u2014time-to-value, ease of deployment, quick reporting. You\u2019ll get suggested hero headlines, subhead, and a short set of proof points to collect\u2014like \u201ctime saved per week\u201d or \u201cdays to first report.\u201d For mid-market, the messaging often shifts to scalability, integrations, governance, and risk reduction. It\u2019ll generate slightly longer bullets, a differentiator section, and objection handling like \u201cWe already have a legacy system\u201d or \u201cImplementation will be heavy,\u201d with recommended counters tied to evidence.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. It looks at what objections show up in your CRM notes and call notes, and it correlates them with wins and losses by segment. Then it drafts talk tracks and \u201cproof points to collect\u201d so you can close the gaps. If mid-market prospects keep asking for references in a specific vertical, it\u2019ll tell you that and suggest what to gather.",

      "text": "Drew Cox: That\u2019s compelling. Our sales reps constantly ask for better battlecards, but we don\u2019t have time to build them from scratch every quarter.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: For a first rollout, we can keep it lightweight: Salesforce opportunity and account fields plus Zendesk tags and ticket text. That\u2019s often enough to get credible segment language and objections. If we add product usage later, that can sharpen fit drivers, but it\u2019s not required to start generating landing page and outbound messaging.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Yes. A typical path is: week one\u2014connect Salesforce and Zendesk, confirm two segment definitions (SMB vs mid-market) and the success metrics. Week two\u2014review the initial recommendations with you and marketing, and we refine the messaging blocks. Week three\u2014export the landing page sections and outbound sequences, and arm sales with the objection playbook. You can be live within 3\u20134 weeks, depending on how quickly we can validate segments.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally. We see that a lot\u2014especially when teams have one narrative they\u2019ve used for years. The way we handle it is we don\u2019t force a wholesale rebrand. We start by picking one tier\u2014say SMB\u2014and run a controlled test: a new landing page variant and a new outbound opener. Then we measure: reply rates, conversion to meeting, and sales cycle signals. If it wins, it becomes easier to bring the org along. If it doesn\u2019t, we adjust with the evidence.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. On procurement and next steps: typically customers your size start with the positioning_recommendation package, then expand once they see uplift. If we\u2019re aligned, I\u2019d propose we lock in a pilot focused on SMB vs mid-market messaging, with clear deliverables: two landing page drafts, two outbound sequences, and a segment-specific objection playbook for each tier.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Two things. First, a quick working session\u201445 minutes\u2014with you and whoever owns marketing messaging to confirm the segment criteria and what \u201cgood\u201d looks like for each tier. Second, an intro to your Salesforce admin and whoever owns Zendesk so we can connect the data sources. After that, we can come back with the first round of recommendations.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Great. Before we close, I want to double-check the potential segment ambiguity issue you mentioned. If we start with a clean SMB vs mid-market split, are you comfortable treating industry/persona as \u201cphase two,\u201d unless the data clearly shows it\u2019s driving outcomes?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: You can. The messaging blocks and drivers stay traceable; when you add a segment dimension, it updates the recommendations and shows you what changed and why. You\u2019re not starting over.",

I\u2019ll send a short proposal today with the pilot scope\u2014SMB vs mid-market positioning recommendations, landing page and outbound assets, and objection playbooks\u2014plus the timeline and the data connections required.

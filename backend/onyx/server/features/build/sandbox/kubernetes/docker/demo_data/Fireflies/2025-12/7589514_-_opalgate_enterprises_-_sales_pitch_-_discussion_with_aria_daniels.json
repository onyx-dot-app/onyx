I work with teams that are drowning in duplicate support tickets and \u201cis this the same issue?\u201d debates between Support, CS, and Engineering. I wanted to share how Issue_Tracker helps create a single, trustworthy view of customer issues without replacing your existing tools. Does that sound relevant?",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair\u2014and Issue_Tracker is meant to sit between Zendesk and Jira, not replace them. The main thing it does is automatically cluster and dedupe incoming tickets, chats, and even call note summaries into issue themes. So instead of 60 separate \u201clogin broken\u201d tickets, you get one cluster with the top phrases, representative examples, and links back to every source ticket in Zendesk. Then you can merge or split clusters with guardrails when something\u2019s actually two different root causes. Does Opalgate see a lot of repeated issues that are hard to quantify?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Makes sense. Where we typically help teams like yours is reducing the manual tagging overhead and making trends visible earlier\u2014especially when issues are phrased differently across channels. Because the clustering uses semantic similarity, it catches duplicates even when the wording is all over the place. Then each cluster keeps a clean \u201cissue object\u201d: suspected category like bug vs UX vs missing feature, affected product area, and the evidence trail back to the original conversations.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: You wouldn\u2019t be managing a second queue. One practical workflow is: Support or CS reviews the cluster, then links the cluster to an existing Jira issue\u2014or creates one if needed. After that, Issue_Tracker just maintains the connection so everyone can see, \u201cThis theme maps to Jira-1234, status in progress, shipped in release X.\u201d It becomes a searchable history of decisions and status across teams, without making people change where they work day to day.",

Linking 200 individual tickets to one Jira item is tedious, and teams often stop after linking a handful, so leadership underestimates impact. With clustering, you get the roll-up automatically: \u201cThis Jira bug affects 214 tickets, 38 accounts,\u201d and you can drill in if needed. It\u2019s less about the link existing and more about the completeness and the trend visibility.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That concern comes up a lot. Two points: first, clusters come with representative examples and top phrases so a human can quickly sanity-check what\u2019s grouped. Second, the merge/split workflow is designed to be reversible and auditable, so if two similar issues get lumped together, you can split them and preserve the decision trail. We also use configurable rules\u2014like product area, platform, severity keywords\u2014so you can constrain clustering to reduce risky merges.",

Then when the linked Jira ticket ships, Issue_Tracker records the release milestone and creates a history trail: which customers were impacted, who was notified, and when. That means fewer \u201cDid anyone tell Aria\u2019s accounts this got fixed?\u201d moments, and it helps you show proactive value in QBRs.",

The automation is more about tracking and prompting internally: \u201cThis cluster shipped; these accounts were subscribed; here are draft notes or a reminder to follow up.\u201d You can keep human approval in the loop. The key is having a reliable list of affected customers tied to the theme, not trying to reconstruct it after the fact.",

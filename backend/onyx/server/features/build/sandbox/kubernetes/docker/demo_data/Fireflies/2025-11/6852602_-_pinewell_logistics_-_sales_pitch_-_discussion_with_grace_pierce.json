I\u2019ll keep this quick: I work with teams that are drowning in support tickets and struggling to turn \u201cnoise\u201d into clear, prioritized issues engineering can act on. Curious\u2014how are you handling customer-reported problems today at Pinewell Logistics?",

    {
      "text": "Grace Pierce: Hi Mina. Sure\u2014so we have Zendesk for support and Jira for engineering. Support tags tickets and escalates the big ones, but it\u2019s pretty manual. We definitely have duplicates and a lot of back-and-forth.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s exactly the gap we focus on. The product is called Issue_Tracker. It sits between Zendesk/Intercom on one side and Jira/Linear on the other, and it standardizes what an \u201cissue\u201d is\u2014theme/root cause, evidence, impacted customers\u2014so you\u2019re not relying on ticket tags and tribal knowledge. In practice, teams ingest thousands of tickets a month and end up with ~80 active themes instead of 5,000 individual threads.",

      "text": "Grace Pierce: The deduping part sounds nice, but we\u2019ve tried macros and tagging projects. It still gets messy. How is this different from just better Zendesk hygiene?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Zendesk is great at managing individual conversations. Issue_Tracker is built for the layer above that: clustering and decisioning. It continuously pulls in tickets, detects duplicates, and groups them into a living cluster with representative examples and a list of affected customers\u2014then routes the top themes to product/engineering weekly. The big difference is it maintains an \u201cissue object\u201d that stays linked to the original customer conversations and the downstream Jira work, so the cluster doesn\u2019t fall apart when people change tags or switch teams.",

So when an account manager pings you, you\u2019re not hunting across Zendesk notes, Slack threads, and Jira comments.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Exactly\u2014issue_history makes communication consistent and audit-friendly. And it creates accountability: when priorities change, there\u2019s a decision note attached, not just a quiet change to a field. Teams use it to cut down internal churn\u2014support stops re-escalating the same thing because they can see status and what\u2019s been communicated.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Also fair. We\u2019re not trying to replace Zendesk or Jira. Most teams keep working where they already work; Issue_Tracker becomes the connective tissue. Support can keep using Zendesk, engineering stays in Jira, and Issue_Tracker keeps the issue clusters and history in sync, with links back to source tickets and forward to the work items. In other words, it reduces dashboards by eliminating the spreadsheets and ad hoc docs people create to track themes.",

      "text": "Mina Park: The lightest-weight rollout is: connect Zendesk, connect Jira, then start with one weekly ritual\u2014your top themes review. Support ops uses Issue_Tracker to cluster and merge duplicates, then shares the top 10 clusters with product/engineering, each with representative examples and affected customer lists. That\u2019s it to start. Over time, people naturally lean on issue_history because it saves time on status questions and customer follow-ups.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Engineering sees a single cluster page: a clear title, a short problem statement/root cause hypothesis, evidence (a handful of the most representative tickets), impact metrics (volume, affected customers, segment/revenue exposure), and then linked Jira items. As work progresses, the status milestones update\u2014so support and customer-facing teams have one source of truth for \u201cwhat\u2019s happening\u201d without pinging engineers.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Great question. For a proper evaluation, we typically do a 30\u201345 minute working session where we map your current flow: Zendesk intake, escalation criteria, your Jira setup, and who runs the weekly triage. If you\u2019re open to it, we can also look at a sample month\u2014say a few thousand tickets\u2014and show you what clustering into ~80 themes would look like, plus what the \u201ctop 10\u201d would be when weighted by customer impact.",

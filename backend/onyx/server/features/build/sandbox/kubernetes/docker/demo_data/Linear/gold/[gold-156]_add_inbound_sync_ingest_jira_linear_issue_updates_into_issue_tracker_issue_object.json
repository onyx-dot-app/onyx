Use polling initially (webhooks in a later ticket) and update only fields that are mapped/configured to avoid overwriting Issue_Tracker-specific context. Persist last_synced_at + external updated_at to support incremental fetch and idempotent processing, and log/alert on permission or missing-issue errors without breaking the link.",

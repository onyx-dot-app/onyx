      "text": "James Choi: Hi Bianca, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re drowning in repeat tickets and it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s truly widespread versus just noisy. I wanted to focus today on how Issue_Tracker would handle your monthly volume and what it would look like operationally for Support Ops at Dunecrown.",

    {
      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: Hi James. Yeah, that\u2019s still the biggest pain. We\u2019re at roughly 5,000 tickets a month, and our team spends a ton of time arguing about what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d versus one-off. I\u2019m open to hearing more, but I\u2019m also wary of another system we have to babysit.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally fair. The core thing we\u2019re pitching is Issue_Tracker as an intelligence and triage layer that sits between Zendesk and Jira\u2014so it\u2019s not replacing either. The feature I think maps most directly to what you said is issue_clustering: it automatically groups tickets, chats, and even call-note summaries into deduped clusters using semantic similarity plus rules you can set\u2014like product area, severity, or keywords. The output is typically something like \u201c80 active themes\u201d instead of 5,000 separate items.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Two differences. First, it\u2019s deduping across channels and wording differences\u2014so \u201capp crash on login\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t sign in, spins forever\u201d get grouped even if agents tag them differently. Second, the cluster itself becomes the object you manage: it has representative examples, top phrases, suggested names, suspected root cause category (bug vs UX vs integration vs missing feature), and\u2014importantly\u2014links back to the source Zendesk tickets so you can prove it\u2019s real. Then you can merge or split clusters with guardrails when the model is too broad or too narrow.",

    {
      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: I like the \u201cprove it\u2019s real\u201d part. But my concern is accuracy. We have multiple subsidiaries and a lot of duplicate contacts in CRM. If you\u2019re linking tickets back to accounts and revenue impact, that\u2019s where things go sideways for us.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s a great callout and it\u2019s one of the known challenges: integration mapping complexity, especially identity resolution and ticket-to-account matching. In practice, we start by mapping the identifiers you trust most\u2014like domain + CRM account ID\u2014and then we set rules for edge cases: duplicate contacts, shared inboxes, custom CRM fields. We also flag \u201cunresolved identity\u201d items so they don\u2019t skew impact calculations.",

      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: But our Zendesk org doesn\u2019t always have clean account IDs. Sometimes it\u2019s just an email, and the email might be a contractor. And we\u2019ve got custom fields that aren\u2019t consistent. If the impact calculation is wrong, we\u2019ll prioritize the wrong things and lose credibility with Product and Engineering.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9088560-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Understood. One way teams handle that is to initially use clustering purely for volume and trend visibility\u2014no revenue weighting\u2014until identity is stable. So week one is: cluster 5,000 tickets into themes, and route the top 10 clusters to your weekly product/engineering review with examples and affected customer lists where available. Then phase two is layering on CRM impact once mapping is validated.",

    {
      "text": "Bianca Ramirez: That phased approach is better. But even just \u201caffected customer lists where available\u201d worries me because \u201cwhere available\u201d is doing a lot of work there. We\u2019ve been burned by tools that promise enrichment and then it\u2019s a lot of manual cleanup.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Fair. Let me make it concrete. For Dunecrown, we\u2019d define the workflow as: Support Ops reviews the top clusters weekly, uses the merge/split controls when something looks off, and exports or syncs the top clusters to Jira as a linked issue theme. Your agents don\u2019t have to change their day-to-day. The only \u201cnew\u201d behavior is someone owning the cluster review\u2014say 30\u201345 minutes a week once it\u2019s tuned.",

The goal is to shorten the meeting because you walk in with \u201chere are the top 10 clusters by volume and severity, with examples,\u201d rather than debating from anecdotes. In other accounts at your scale, it\u2019s been the difference between a two-hour meeting and a 45-minute one.",

We have a lot of issues that look similar but come from different site configurations.",

      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s exactly why the merge/split workflow exists. When Engineering says \u201cthese are two different root causes,\u201d you split the cluster and keep the history of why. Over time, you end up with a defensible taxonomy of issues and decisions instead of starting from scratch every week.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Hi Kent, good to see you again. Last time you mentioned your growth team is trying to tighten up inbound speed-to-lead and make sure reps aren\u2019t missing follow-ups once a discovery call happens. I wanted to focus today on Sales_Accelerator\u2014specifically the sales follow-up recommendations\u2014so we can decide if it\u2019s worth piloting at Pacific Ember Foods.",

    {
      "text": "Kent Delgado: Hi Irene. Yep, that\u2019s still the pain. We\u2019ve got leads coming in from a couple channels, and response time is inconsistent. But I also want to be upfront: anything that reads emails or call notes tends to get blocked pretty quickly here.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/8316931-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: That makes sense. Let me anchor on the workflow, then we can dig into compliance. Sales_Accelerator sits on top of Salesforce\u2014so no rip-and-replace\u2014and it consumes the fit scores and positioning blocks you already built in Customer_Analyzer. The idea is: when an inbound lead comes in, it prioritizes the high-fit ones for first-touch, recommends a first response message tailored to the lead, and then\u2014once meetings happen\u2014keeps opportunities from stalling by recommending the next best action per deal.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: It can, but it doesn\u2019t have to. You can configure it to: (1) suggest a template and key talking points, or (2) draft a full email that the rep edits before sending. For your inbound speed-to-lead use case, most teams start with template-plus-bullets so reps move fast without feeling like AI is \u201csending for them.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: The sales_followup_recommendations. Think of it as deal-progression guidance and a lightweight task queue right inside Salesforce. It looks at stage, who\u2019s engaged, whether there\u2019s a mutual action plan, and recent activity. Then it nudges reps with very specific next steps\u2014like \u201csend recap + confirm next meeting date,\u201d \u201cmulti-thread because only one stakeholder is active,\u201d or \u201cfill the mutual plan checklist and set reminders.\u201d It also suggests cadence and channel mix, so your team\u2019s follow-through is consistent.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Great question. It\u2019s less about adding tasks and more about prioritizing and standardizing what good looks like. For example, instead of ten generic tasks, it creates a small queue of \u201chighest-impact next steps\u201d based on what actually happened. If a meeting occurred and there\u2019s no follow-up logged in 24 hours, it recommends the recap email. If only one contact has been emailed in a week, it suggests multi-threading and even proposes who to add\u2014based on the persona blocks from Customer_Analyzer. It\u2019s \u201cwhat to do next\u201d rather than \u201cdo more activity.\u201d",

For deeper risk signals\u2014like detecting that next steps weren\u2019t agreed\u2014it can optionally analyze call notes or transcripts if you connect your call recording system. But that\u2019s optional, and we can start with CRM-only signals.",

For many customers, we process and only retain derived signals\u2014like \u201cfollow-up missing\u201d or \u201cstakeholder coverage low\u201d\u2014and we can set retention windows. We also support excluding fields, redaction patterns, and limiting to specific objects. But I don\u2019t want to hand-wave it\u2014your compliance requirements would drive the final setup.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Understood. On training: we don\u2019t train models on your customer communications by default. Retention: we can set it, and we can keep processing scoped. Regions: we can align with your data residency needs depending on your plan. If we keep phase one to CRM metadata plus Customer_Analyzer outputs, we sidestep most of the email/call content concerns while still improving speed-to-lead and follow-up consistency.",

The objection response feature is strongest when it can see the objection, yes\u2014but we can keep that out of scope initially. For the pilot, I\u2019d focus on two outcomes: faster first-touch on high-fit inbound, and fewer deals stalled because no next step is locked.",

If we do a pilot that\u2019s \u201cCRM-only task recommendations,\u201d I worry reps ignore it because it\u2019s not actually saving them time.

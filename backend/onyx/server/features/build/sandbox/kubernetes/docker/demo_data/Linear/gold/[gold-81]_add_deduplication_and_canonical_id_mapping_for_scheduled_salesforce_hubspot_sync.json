Introduce a canonical record mapping keyed by CRM record ID + workspace, with merge/conflict rules for in-scope fields and safe handling of deletes/ID changes. Ensure dedupe outcomes are logged/metriced per run so Sales_Accelerator uses a single stable internal entity for forecasting and next-best-action.",

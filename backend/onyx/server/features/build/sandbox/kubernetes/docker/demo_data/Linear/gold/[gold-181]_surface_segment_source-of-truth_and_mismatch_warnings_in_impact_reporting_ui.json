When a segment is unmapped or flagged as unknown/mismatched by the canonicalization layer, show a clear warning state and prevent blending totals across conflicting definitions. Add a lightweight tooltip/label linking to the segment mapping entry to aid triage and reduce confusion in segment-based revenue/customer impact views.",

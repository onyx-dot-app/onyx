I work with teams that get a lot of customer-reported issues coming in from Zendesk, Intercom, emails, and internal notes, and they struggle to turn that noise into something engineering and CS can actually act on.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Totally. The product is called Issue_Tracker. It sits between your support channels and delivery tools like Jira or Linear, and it standardizes an \u201cissue object\u201d\u2014so instead of hundreds of tickets that all say the same thing differently, you get deduped clusters like \u201cSample upload fails on Safari\u201d with evidence, impacted customers, and links back to the original tickets and conversations.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Great question. Tagging helps, but it usually breaks down when wording varies or when multiple teams use different tags. Issue_Tracker\u2019s issue_clustering automatically groups raw inputs using semantic similarity plus rules you control\u2014like product area, platform, severity, or keywords\u2014so you can see \u201cthis is actually one underlying problem\u201d even if it came in through 40 tickets and a couple CSM notes.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: That\u2019s exactly what we try to avoid. It doesn\u2019t replace Zendesk or Jira\u2014those remain the systems of record. Issue_Tracker links back to them. The workflow is typically: clusters get created automatically, someone can quickly merge or split with guardrails, and then you connect a cluster to an existing Jira ticket or create one. After that, everyone sees the same status without manually stitching together spreadsheets or searching through ticket threads.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Usually Support Ops or a triage lead owns the clustering review, but CSMs get a lot of value too. One common use case: CSMs subscribe key accounts to specific clusters\u2014so if Bayfront Helix Genetics has a few strategic customers hitting the same issue, you can track which customers are impacted and make follow-up consistent. When the linked Jira ticket ships, Issue_Tracker records the release milestone and keeps a history of who was notified and when.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Makes sense. The gap we see is that Jira is built around engineering work items, not customer impact. Issue_Tracker keeps the issue cluster tied to the source evidence and affected accounts, so you can answer: \u201cHow widespread is this? Which segments are impacted? Are we underestimating it because it\u2019s spread across channels?\u201d And your CSMs don\u2019t have to hunt for status or wonder which customers they already updated.",

    {

    },
    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Understood. On volume, even moderate volumes can hide trends because the same problem shows up with different phrasing. The clustering is mostly about surfacing the true \u201ctheme count\u201d and making prioritization defensible. On data, we can scope what\u2019s ingested\u2014some teams start with metadata and summaries rather than full transcripts, and keep the links pointing back to Zendesk where permissions already live.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Got it. If the status quo is acceptable, it may not be worth the change management. The reason I asked for time is that teams often realize they\u2019re missing revenue risk or repeat churn drivers because the evidence is fragmented.

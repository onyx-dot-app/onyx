      "text": "Today, warning_alerts can generate repeated notifications across successive sync runs for the same account/opportunity and underlying condition, resulting in duplicate emails and Slack messages. This creates alert fatigue, makes it harder for teams to identify genuinely new or changed risk signals, and can reduce trust in the alerting system.\n\nThis feature will introduce cross-channel deduplication and rate-limiting by making warning_alerts idempotent. We\u2019ll persist an idempotency key per `{object_id, alert_type, threshold_state}` and apply a TTL/cooldown so an alert is only sent once while the condition remains true, then becomes eligible to send again only when the state clears and re-triggers or after a configured interval.\n\nThe impact is fewer redundant notifications and a clearer \u201csignal-to-noise\u201d ratio for customer-facing and internal teams. Customers receive a more reliable alerting experience, Slack/email delivery becomes consistent (no one channel spamming while the other stays quiet), and overall operational load from investigating \u201crepeat alerts\u201d decreases.\n\nWe\u2019ll validate behavior with a focused test suite covering duplicate sync runs (no re-send) and \u201cclear then re-trigger\u201d flows (re-send on re-trigger), plus cooldown behavior. Success can be measured by a reduction in duplicate alert deliveries per object/condition, fewer customer complaints about repeated alerts, and stable notification volumes aligned to true state changes rather than sync frequency.",

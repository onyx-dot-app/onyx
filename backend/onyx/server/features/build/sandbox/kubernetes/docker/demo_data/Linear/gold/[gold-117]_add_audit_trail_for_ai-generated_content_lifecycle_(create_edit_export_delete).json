Each event should record actor, timestamp, artifact ID/type, source context (account/opportunity), and before/after diffs for edits, and be queryable by Sales Ops/Admin for compliance reviews. Ensure logs are captured server-side for both UI and API actions and are retained independent of RBAC UI gating.",

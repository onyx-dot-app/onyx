      "text": "This feature adds tenant-configurable retention policy enforcement for AI-generated artifacts\u2014such as emails, call notes, and next-best-action recommendations\u2014along with their associated audit records. Today, these records can persist indefinitely, creating compliance and governance risk for customers with strict data minimization requirements and increasing our long-term storage and operational burden. By making retention periods configurable per tenant, we support diverse regulatory and contractual obligations without requiring bespoke deployments.\n\nOn the backend, we will implement retention rules that determine when AI-generated records (and linked audit records) are considered expired. A scheduled cleanup job will then apply the configured policy by either hard-deleting or anonymizing expired data, while preserving referential integrity (e.g., avoiding broken foreign keys and ensuring dependent objects don\u2019t error). Once a record is expired and processed, it must no longer be accessible via API or UI to any user, effectively enforcing the retention boundary rather than relying on front-end filtering.\n\nTo help admins validate that policies are behaving correctly, we will expose retention metadata (e.g., retention status, expiry timestamp, and whether deletion vs. anonymization applies) in admin-facing surfaces and/or APIs. This will enable customers to audit policy outcomes and troubleshoot configuration issues without introducing new access control pathways. Importantly, we will not duplicate existing RBAC or audit event capture mechanisms; instead, we\u2019ll leverage current authorization and audit pipelines and focus purely on retention lifecycle and visibility.\n\nThe impact is improved compliance posture (GDPR/CCPA-style minimization, internal retention policies), reduced customer risk around AI-generated content governance, and lower ongoing storage footprint. It also clarifies operational expectations: data will reliably expire based on tenant policy, become inaccessible after expiry, and provide transparent, admin-verifiable signals that retention is being enforced\u2014without expanding the scope of permissions or auditing beyond what already exists.",

      "text": "This feature adds segment-scoped positioning template retrieval and display in the Segment Detail view, wiring the frontend to a new API that returns the positioning template for the currently selected segment. The UI will render the template\u2019s core sections\u2014value propositions, differentiators, proof points, and objections\u2014so users can see segment-specific positioning context directly alongside other segment data.\n\nThe primary user impact is improved clarity and confidence when working within a segment: teams will no longer need to infer or hunt for positioning guidance elsewhere. By showing the template content in a consistent, structured layout, the Segment Detail view becomes the single place to understand \u201chow we position\u201d for that segment, which should reduce misalignment and speed downstream work (messaging, sales enablement, campaign planning).\n\nThe experience will include robust states for real-world conditions: loading while the template is fetched, an empty state when no content exists, and an error state if the request fails. When a segment has no customized template, the UI will fall back to server-provided default templates so users still see a complete structure and baseline guidance rather than a blank experience.\n\nThis ticket is intentionally read-only: it establishes the data plumbing and presentation layer needed for future iteration. Subsequent tickets can add inline editing and save behavior on top of this foundation without reworking the fetching, fallback logic, or state handling.",

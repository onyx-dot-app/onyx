We help product, marketing, and sales teams get really crisp on which customer segments are actually a great fit right now\u2014and then turn that into messaging your teams can use immediately.",

      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally. Most teams have an ICP slide, but it\u2019s often based on a mix of anecdotes and outdated assumptions. Customer_Analyzer ingests signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and outputs two things: a fit score by segment, and positioning recommendations tailored to the segments you should prioritize.",

You can see, for example, \u201cIndustry A retains 15% better but generates 2x support load,\u201d versus \u201cIndustry B retains slightly lower but scales cleanly.\u201d",

For Aurorakite Software, we\u2019d typically pull core CRM fields for industry and deal context, product usage events for adoption, and support ticket metadata for burden. If you don\u2019t have perfect instrumentation, that\u2019s fine\u2014we\u2019ll still produce a first-pass segment fit score and then show you what signals would improve confidence.",

Once the fit score identifies, say, two segments worth prioritizing next quarter, Customer_Analyzer generates editable messaging blocks for each segment: a segment-specific value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, proof points you should collect, pricing/value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook.",

And the key is it\u2019s linked back to evidence\u2014what drivers we saw in usage, what language shows up in support tickets or survey responses\u2014so your team can trust it and iterate instead of debating opinions.",

If your team says, \u201cHealthcare is our best segment,\u201d the system can show: retention trend, time-to-value, support burden, and which product behaviors correlate with renewals. Then the positioning recommendation translates that into, \u201cLead with X benefit, prove it with Y proof point, and handle the Z objection this way.\u201d",

The objection playbook is anchored to what we see in your real customer language\u2014support tickets, call notes, onboarding feedback\u2014so it reflects what prospects in that segment actually push back on.

The output is designed to be shared across functions: product can see the fit drivers, marketing gets segment-specific positioning, and sales gets usable talk tracks and email openers.

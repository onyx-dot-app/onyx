      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates recommendation/message generation to always use a pinned `positioningBlockVersionId` (sourced from the stored `Customer_Analyzer` version set) instead of resolving to `latest` at runtime.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Selection: the generator now requires/derives a concrete `positioningBlockVersionId` from the customer\u2019s saved analyzer versions and passes that through the entire render pipeline.\n- Persistence: the chosen `positioningBlockVersionId` is written onto the generated `Recommendation`/`Message` record at creation time and is reused for re-renders, edits, and follow-up sequence steps.\n- Runtime behavior changes:\n  - Removed implicit \u201clatest\u201d resolution from render/regeneration paths.\n  - If the requested/pinned version cannot be found (deleted/unavailable), the flow fails with a clear, actionable error.\n  - As a fallback, the system attempts to use the last known pinned version for that record/customer (no silent auto-upgrade to a newer Marketing version).\n\nNotes:\n- This is a behavior-stability change aimed at preventing content drift when Marketing publishes new positioning block versions; existing content will continue to render against the version it was originally generated with.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n",

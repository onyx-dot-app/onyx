      "text": "Score computation currently receives inconsistent frequency and/or severity values (e.g., counting conversations vs. unique customers, missing severity defaulting differently across sources), leading to unstable priority scores. Standardize the upstream metric derivation so each issue theme produces deterministic `frequency` (define and implement a single counting rule) and `severity` (single normalization + default) before handing off to the scoring service. Add unit/integration coverage to prevent regressions when ingestion/deduping logic changes.",

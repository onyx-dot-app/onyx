It pulls in the customer signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding survey responses, product usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and turns them into two things teams actually use: a fit score by segment, and positioning recommendations you can deploy in marketing and sales.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That messiness is exactly the point. Customer_Analyzer doesn\u2019t just summarize\u2014it identifies the \u201cfit drivers\u201d that correlate with strong outcomes for you, and then generates segment-specific messaging based on what high-fit customers actually say and do. So instead of debating internally, you get evidence-backed positioning blocks you can edit and ship.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Concretely: for a prioritized segment\u2014say SMB utilities versus mid-market industrial customers\u2014it produces an editable package: a segment-specific value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, proof points to collect, pricing/value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook. And it formats the output into usable pieces like website hero copy, sales deck bullets, and outbound email openers. Every line is linked back to the drivers and evidence it used.",

For example, you could spin up two landing pages\u2014SMB and mid-market\u2014where the hero, the problem framing, and the proof points actually reflect what those segments care about. Then your outbound team gets matching email openers and objection handling, so it\u2019s consistent from first click to sales call.",

Then it recommends responses tied to evidence: which proof points to use, what differentiators to emphasize for that segment, and how to frame pricing/value. It\u2019s not generic; it\u2019s segmented.",

You don\u2019t need perfect data on day one. The goal is to quickly generate a \u201cversion one\u201d positioning package for two tiers\u2014SMB vs mid-market\u2014so you can validate it with your team and in-market.",

We\u2019d ingest those signals, then you\u2019d pick the segments you care about\u2014like employee size, industry, or geography\u2014and Customer_Analyzer would produce fit scores and positioning recommendations for each.

The recommendations are generated from the drivers we observe in your data\u2014what correlates with renewals, expansion, activation, fewer tickets, faster onboarding, whatever metrics you choose. And it uses real customer language from surveys and tickets, so the messaging reflects how your customers describe the problem and value.

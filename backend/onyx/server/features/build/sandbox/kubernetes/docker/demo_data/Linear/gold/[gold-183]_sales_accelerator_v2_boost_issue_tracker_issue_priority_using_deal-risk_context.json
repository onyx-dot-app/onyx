Include clear weighting/thresholds and caps so boosts are explainable and don\u2019t override critical manual priority settings. Emit an audit trail on the issue (e.g., \u201cpriority boosted due to deal risk\u201d) and add metrics/logging for boosts applied vs. skipped (missing/invalid context).",

      "text": "This feature introduces the foundational scoring schema that powers Warning Alerts v3 for predictive **slippage risk** and **loss risk**. It defines a normalized, consistent output contract\u2014**risk type**, **score**, and **confidence**\u2014that downstream systems can rely on to trigger alerts and measure accuracy over time.\n\nThe work centralizes and formalizes the required inputs to the model, including relevant **CRM fields**, **product/activity signals**, and the **Customer_Analyzer fit score**. By explicitly documenting assumptions and dependencies, we reduce ambiguity across Sales, CS, Data, and Engineering about what data is required, how it is interpreted, and what happens when inputs are missing or stale.\n\nEngineering impact is focused on a minimal but production-grade implementation: a first-pass scoring function shipped **behind a feature flag**, with **unit tests** and clear documentation. This allows us to validate scoring behavior safely in production-like environments, support iterative improvements, and establish a stable API for future enhancements.\n\nOut of scope for this ticket are **driver ranking**, **recommended actions**, and **UI rendering**, but this schema is the prerequisite that unblocks them. Once implemented, teams can begin evaluating alert quality, calibrating thresholds, and instrumenting downstream workflows while maintaining a clear separation between scoring logic and presentation/experience.",

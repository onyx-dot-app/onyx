      "text": "Megan Foster: Appreciate it. I work with teams that are drowning in customer issues spread across Zendesk, Intercom, emails, and internal notes\u2014and the problem is it all stays fragmented, so product and engineering only see a noisy, incomplete picture. The product I wanted to quickly introduce is Issue_Tracker. It sits between your support channels and your delivery tools like Jira or Linear, and it turns raw tickets and messages into deduped \u201cissue clusters\u201d with clear evidence and impacted customer lists.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: It wouldn\u2019t replace Zendesk or Jira. Think of it as a triage and intelligence layer that standardizes the \u201cissue object\u201d\u2014the theme, suspected root cause, examples, and who\u2019s impacted\u2014then links it back to the original Zendesk conversations and forward to the Jira work. The core feature is issue clustering: it automatically groups related tickets, chats, and even call note summaries into one cluster, suggests a name, pulls top phrases, and gives you a merge/split workflow so you can clean it up without losing the audit trail.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s fair. The difference is scale and consistency. A typical support ops use case is taking something like 5,000 monthly tickets and collapsing it into ~80 active themes\u2014then routing the top 10 clusters to product/engineering weekly with representative examples and the list of affected customers. Instead of \u201cwe saw a few reports,\u201d you can say \u201cthis cluster has 143 tickets in two weeks, affects Enterprise customers, likely root cause is integration, and here are the top examples.\u201d",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally\u2014ticket volume varies a lot by org. Where it still tends to help even at lower volumes is deduping the long tail and making trends visible earlier. Often the same issue shows up as slightly different tickets across different categories, and teams underestimate how widespread it is until it turns into an escalation. With clustering, you get that roll-up automatically, plus the searchable history of \u201cwhat decision was made, when, and why,\u201d tied to source conversations.",

Then you can route the top clusters to product/engineering with the evidence packaged up: examples, top phrases, affected accounts, and links back to the originals. Support ops spends less time consolidating, and product gets cleaner input.",

      "text": "Megan Foster: Great question\u2014usually Support Ops or a Support lead is the day-to-day owner, with Product as a key consumer. The reason it sticks is the workflow: support continues working in Zendesk; engineering continues working in Jira; Issue_Tracker is the connective tissue and the place the \u201cissue clusters\u201d live. But it does require someone to own the merge/split and keep the clusters tidy, at least lightly.",

The clustering can still leverage your existing metadata\u2014product area, severity, keywords\u2014so it\u2019s not throwing that work away. It uses semantic similarity plus configurable rules. But I hear you: if your process is already working and you don\u2019t have a lot of noise, the ROI might be harder to justify.",

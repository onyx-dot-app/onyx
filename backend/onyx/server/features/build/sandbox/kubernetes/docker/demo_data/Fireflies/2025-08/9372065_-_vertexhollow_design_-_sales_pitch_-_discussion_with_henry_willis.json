      "text": "Camila Vega: Hi Henry\u2014Camila Vega here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll keep it tight: I wanted to share how Issue_Tracker helps teams like Vertexhollow Design turn scattered support tickets and feature requests into a clear, prioritized set of \u201cissue themes\u201d that product, support, and sales can all act on.",

      "text": "Henry Willis: Hey Camila, sure\u2014what do you mean by \u201cissue themes\u201d? We already have Zendesk and Jira, so I\u2019m curious what\u2019s different.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally fair. We\u2019re not trying to replace Zendesk or Jira. Issue_Tracker sits between them and standardizes what an \u201cissue\u201d is\u2014so instead of 40 separate tickets that look slightly different, it deduplicates and clusters them into one theme with evidence, root cause notes, and the impacted customers\u2014all still linked back to the original conversations and to the downstream Jira work.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Two places I think you\u2019d feel quickly. First is issue prioritization. Once Issue_Tracker clusters the noise into themes, it ranks those clusters with an explainable priority score\u2014based on things you can configure, like frequency and velocity, severity tags, customer tier/ARR, churn risk flags, and segment importance. So it\u2019s not just \u201cwhat\u2019s loudest,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s most business-critical.\u201d",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. Issue_Tracker makes the logic shared and defensible. Support can view it through an SLA-risk lens, product can look at impact vs. effort, sales can see deal blockers, and execs see revenue exposure. Same underlying issue object\u2014different view, aligned prioritization.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Setup is usually lightweight because we pull from the systems you already use. For example, frequency/velocity comes from Zendesk or Intercom volume. Customer tier/ARR and segment importance can come from your CRM. Severity tags can be inferred from support metadata or defined rules. And the key is: the priority score is explainable, so when someone asks \u201cwhy is this #2,\u201d it shows the factors that drove it.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great question. One of the most common CS use cases is consistent customer follow-up. Your CSMs can subscribe accounts to relevant issue clusters\u2014so if Henry\u2019s managing a set of accounts impacted by, say, \u201cexport failures in large projects,\u201d those accounts are attached to that cluster. Then when the linked Jira ticket ships, Issue_Tracker records the release milestone and automatically builds a history trail of which customers were notified and when.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Yes, and it\u2019s still the same core capability: prioritization with business context. If an issue is tied to high-ARR accounts or churn risk flags, it can bubble up. And for pipeline, Issue_Tracker can integrate with your CRM and tools like Sales_Accelerator so clusters that are blocking late-stage opportunities get boosted\u2014so teams aren\u2019t surprised when an \u201cold bug\u201d suddenly becomes a forecast problem.",

So CS doesn\u2019t have to chase product for status, and product doesn\u2019t have to guess which issues carry the most commercial risk.",

Then we\u2019d tune a simple priority model and validate it with you: does the top 10 match what you intuitively feel, and can we explain the differences?",

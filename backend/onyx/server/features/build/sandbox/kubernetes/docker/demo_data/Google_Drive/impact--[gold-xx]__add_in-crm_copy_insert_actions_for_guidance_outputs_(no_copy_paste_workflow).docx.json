      "text": "This feature adds in-CRM \u201ccopy\u201d and \u201cinsert\u201d actions to the embedded Guidance panel so reps can use generated outputs (next actions, risk alerts, positioning snippets) directly within Salesforce or HubSpot without leaving their workflow. Instead of manually selecting text and switching tabs to paste it into a task or note, reps will be able to take a one-click action from each guidance block.\n\nThe primary impact is a significant reduction in friction and time-to-value for Guidance: reps can immediately operationalize outputs into the system of record, which should increase usage, improve follow-through on recommended actions, and reduce errors introduced by manual copy/paste. Clear success/error feedback builds trust that content was captured correctly and avoids uncertainty that often leads to abandoning the workflow.\n\nFrom a CRM data quality and consistency standpoint, structured insertion into supported targets (e.g., Salesforce Task/Note or HubSpot Note/Activity) should increase documentation rates and standardize how insights are recorded against the correct Account/Opportunity. This also makes downstream reporting, coaching, and collaboration easier because guidance is stored in the right place, tied to the correct record context.\n\nThe key dependencies and risks are CRM API permissions and context handling: inserts must reliably target the active record and gracefully handle unsupported objects, missing access, or API failures. Ensuring tight UX (per-block actions, correct mapping to CRM fields, and actionable error messages) will be critical to adoption, since the feature is specifically intended to remove the \u201ccopy/paste\u201d pain that keeps reps from using Guidance consistently.",

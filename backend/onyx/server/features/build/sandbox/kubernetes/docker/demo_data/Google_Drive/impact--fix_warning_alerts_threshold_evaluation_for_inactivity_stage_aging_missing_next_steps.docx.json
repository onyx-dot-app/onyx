      "text": "This change fixes incorrect or inconsistent triggering of threshold-based `warning_alerts` related to inactivity days, stage aging, and missing next steps. Today, these alerts can fire too early, too late, or intermittently because the underlying calculations are not standardized across conditions and can be affected by timezone differences, \u201cnow\u201d being computed differently in different places, null/missing CRM fields, and partial or delayed CRM sync updates.\n\nWith this work, we will standardize the computation of inactivity, stage age, and next-step status from CRM data using a single time basis and consistent rules. We will add safe handling for missing or null fields (e.g., no activity history or no recorded stage change) so alerts degrade gracefully rather than behaving unpredictably. We will also prevent double-counting or duplicate triggers that can happen when CRM records arrive in multiple updates or out of order.\n\nUser impact: teams relying on these warnings will see fewer false positives and fewer missed alerts, improving trust in the system and reducing alert fatigue. This should increase the usefulness of warnings for driving timely follow-up and pipeline hygiene, because alerts will more reliably reflect true inactivity, actual time spent in stage, and genuinely missing next steps.\n\nEngineering impact: we\u2019ll add unit tests for key edge cases (no activity history, stage change today, next-step cleared, and related boundary conditions) to lock in correct behavior and prevent regressions. Over time, this should reduce support/debug time spent investigating \u201cwhy did this warning fire?\u201d issues and make the alerting logic safer to extend.",

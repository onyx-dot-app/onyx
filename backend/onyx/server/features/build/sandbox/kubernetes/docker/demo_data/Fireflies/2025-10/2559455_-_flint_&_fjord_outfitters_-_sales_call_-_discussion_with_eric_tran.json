      "text": "Eric Tran: Yeah, it is. We\u2019ve got a lot of opinions internally and not a lot of agreement, so anything that helps us be more objective is interesting. But we\u2019re also trying not to add another tool that becomes \u201canother dashboard nobody trusts.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Totally fair. If it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll keep this focused on one thing: how Customer_Analyzer produces a fit score with the \u201cwhy\u201d behind it, and how that supports product planning\u2014so your roadmap bets map to high-fit customers with unmet needs. Then we can see if it\u2019s worth moving to procurement steps or not.",

      "text": "James Choi: Great. So the core is our fit_estimation feature. You connect the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding survey responses, product usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and we compute a fit score from 0 to 100 at both the account level and the segment level. The important part is we don\u2019t just spit out a number; we show the driver breakdown\u2014what\u2019s pushing fit up or down\u2014and comparisons across segments, like SMB vs mid-market.",

    {
      "text": "Eric Tran: Okay. But how do you decide the drivers? Because that\u2019s where these things fall apart. Sales will say \u201cindustry and willingness to pay,\u201d support will say \u201csupport burden,\u201d product will say \u201cadoption,\u201d and marketing will say \u201csegment narratives.\u201d We\u2019ve lived that movie.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: You\u2019re describing exactly the situation we\u2019re built for\u2014conflicting internal stakeholder opinions. We handle it two ways. First, the drivers are configurable: you can start with a standard set\u2014firmographics, time-to-value, adoption patterns, churn risk signals\u2014and then tune. Second, we tie driver weights back to observed outcomes like retention, expansion, and conversion. So instead of debating in the abstract, you can see, \u201cWhen adoption looks like X and support burden looks like Y, renewal risk goes up,\u201d or \u201cThese characteristics correlate with faster time-to-value.\u201d",

      "text": "Eric Tran: That sounds good in theory, but we don\u2019t have clean data. CRM fields are inconsistent, product events are messy, and support tickets don\u2019t always map to accounts cleanly. If the inputs are garbage, the score is garbage.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s a common concern. In practice we don\u2019t require perfection to get value. We can start with the signals you trust most\u2014say, usage and retention\u2014and add the others over time. And the driver breakdown helps you see where the score is relying on thin data versus strong data. You can also compare segments even if individual accounts are noisy.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9215940-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Eric Tran: But then we\u2019re back to trust. If the score says a segment is low fit and Sales has three \u201cbig logos\u201d in that segment they\u2019re excited about, the meeting turns into \u201cthe tool is wrong.\u201d And the tool loses.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9215940-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: I hear you. One way teams avoid that is by treating fit score as a decision support input, not a verdict. For example, for product planning you can use it to highlight where the product is winning today\u2014high fit, high retention\u2014and then look for unmet needs inside that zone to guide roadmap. It\u2019s less threatening than using it to tell Sales they shouldn\u2019t pursue a deal.",

      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/9215940-12"

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Let me map it to that. Say you\u2019re choosing between building Feature A for mid-market outdoor retailers vs improving onboarding for SMB brands. Customer_Analyzer will show segment-level fit: mid-market might score, say, 72 with strong willingness-to-pay but longer time-to-value and higher support burden; SMB might score 81 with faster adoption but lower expansion. Then you can drill into the driver breakdown to see what\u2019s actually limiting fit\u2014maybe time-to-value is the bottleneck for mid-market. That points to the roadmap bet with the highest expected impact on outcomes you care about\u2014conversion, retention, expansion.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Makes sense. The difference is speed and repeatability. Spreadsheets can do the analysis once, but then it becomes a quarterly fire drill and every team tweaks the logic. Customer_Analyzer keeps it consistent, and it becomes a shared reference point.",

      "text": "Eric Tran: Okay, but let\u2019s talk about the internal stakeholder conflict you mentioned. That\u2019s real for us. Marketing wants to go upmarket, Sales wants anything with budget, Product wants fewer edge cases, and support is drowning. If your tool outputs a score, it doesn\u2019t solve the politics. It might make it worse.",

The teams that succeed treat the first month as calibration: agree on a short list of drivers, run the score, then review the \u201cwhy\u201d together. The goal isn\u2019t to eliminate disagreement; it\u2019s to make the disagreement specific and testable. Like, \u201cDoes support burden actually predict churn for us?\u201d instead of \u201csupport is mad.\u201d",

Let me ask one more thing to see if there\u2019s a narrow path: if we could produce a credible segment-level fit comparison using only anonymized or aggregated data\u2014no PII\u2014would that change anything?

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Totally. The product is called Issue_Tracker. It\u2019s a layer that sits between your support channels\u2014like Zendesk or Intercom\u2014your delivery tools like Jira or Linear, and your customer context in Salesforce or HubSpot. It continuously ingests customer-reported issues, deduplicates them into clusters, and ties them back to impacted customers and opportunities\u2014so Sales can see what\u2019s real, what\u2019s duplicative noise, and what\u2019s actually threatening revenue.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Great question. Most setups connect systems, but they don\u2019t standardize the \u201cissue object.\u201d Issue_Tracker creates a single, searchable issue cluster\u2014root cause + evidence + impacted accounts\u2014linked to every source ticket and to the downstream Jira work. The big difference is it stays defensible: you can click from the cluster to the original tickets, and from the cluster to the engineering item, without duplicate data entry or someone manually curating spreadsheets.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: That makes sense. Where Issue_Tracker tends to help is when \u201cit works\u201d until it doesn\u2019t\u2014like when Sales hears about an issue from a prospect, but Support has 37 tickets that are all slightly different phrasing, and Engineering has three Jira tickets that may or may not be the same root cause. With Issue_Tracker, you can set dedupe rules and field mapping so those become one theme, with consistent metadata, and a single status/ETA narrative that\u2019s safe for customer-facing teams.",

      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Exactly\u2014and that\u2019s one of the use cases I wanted to highlight. When a late-stage opportunity is tied to a known issue cluster, Issue_Tracker can surface the current status, any ETA notes, and even approved language\u2014what\u2019s safe to communicate\u2014so Sales doesn\u2019t freelanced their own story. It also integrates with Sales_Accelerator so the deal can be flagged \u201cat risk\u201d based on the issue\u2019s status and impact.",

    {
      "text": "Arjun Mehta: Understood. Even without Sales_Accelerator, the core value still stands: the connector to Salesforce can link clusters to accounts and opportunities, so you can prioritize issues based on business impact\u2014revenue exposure, ICP segment, or deal risk\u2014rather than whoever yelled loudest in Slack. If data hygiene is uneven, we usually start with light-touch field mapping: account ID, segment, opportunity stage\u2014just enough to be useful.",

And for context: Salesforce/HubSpot plus Customer_Analyzer fit/segment IDs if you have them. You can start with just Zendesk + Jira + Salesforce. Then define dedupe rules\u2014like matching by error signature, keywords, product area, or custom fields. The goal is to keep Zendesk and Jira as systems of record; Issue_Tracker just synchronizes metadata and adds back-links so teams can navigate without re-entering anything.",

The reason teams use this is it replaces the manual \u201ctranslation layer\u201d between teams\u2014spreadsheets, internal docs, recurring meetings to align on what\u2019s actually happening. Instead of another dashboard, it\u2019s more like: \u201cHere\u2019s the cluster, here\u2019s the evidence, here\u2019s impacted accounts, here\u2019s the Jira link, here\u2019s what we can safely tell customers.\u201d It becomes the one place to answer \u201cis this a known issue\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s the real status.\u201d",

It can capture status notes and decision history in a way that\u2019s searchable and attributable\u2014so if Engineering says \u201cinvestigating root cause; workaround exists,\u201d that\u2019s what gets surfaced, with the supporting tickets linked. It helps Sales and Support avoid guessing. And because clusters are deduped, you don\u2019t have 50 tickets all asking for updates separately\u2014Support can update one cluster and it propagates contextually.",

The only reason I reached out is I\u2019ve seen snack/CPG brands with ecommerce + wholesale pipelines get hit with deal slippage when a recurring issue pops up\u2014like order routing bugs, integration failures, or reporting inaccuracies\u2014and Sales doesn\u2019t have a crisp, approved status to share.

One lightweight way some teams start is simply using the Zendesk + Jira sync and dedupe clustering to reduce duplicate engineering asks\u2014without trying to model every operational workflow.

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Great question. Issue_Tracker isn\u2019t trying to replace Zendesk or Jira. It sits between them and standardizes what we call an \u201cissue object\u201d\u2014a theme or root cause with evidence, impacted customers, and links back to the original conversations and forward to the engineering work. So instead of hundreds of tickets and scattered Jira items, you get a deduped set of themes that stays connected to both sides.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: The most immediate win is clustering and deduplication. If you\u2019re getting, say, thousands of tickets a month, Issue_Tracker groups them into a manageable set of active themes\u2014think dozens, not thousands\u2014then merges duplicates and keeps representative examples. Support ops can route the top themes to product/engineering weekly with a clean packet: what\u2019s happening, how often, which customers are impacted, and the source links.",

Issue_Tracker assigns each cluster a priority score based on inputs you control: frequency and velocity, severity tags, customer tier or ARR, churn risk flags, and segment importance. It\u2019s transparent\u2014so it\u2019s not a black box \u201cAI says fix this,\u201d it\u2019s \u201chere\u2019s why this cluster is ranked #3.\u201d",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: You can weight issues based on your ideal customer profile and strategic segments\u2014so if a theme hits high-fit, high-value customers, it rises. And if you want, it can integrate with your CRM context so issues tied to revenue exposure or key accounts are naturally elevated. The goal is to align Support, Product, and Sales around the same logic instead of each team having their own list.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: We built for that reality.

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: It\u2019s light. Since we\u2019re not replacing Zendesk or Jira, there\u2019s no rip-and-replace. We connect to your support channel, ingest ticket and conversation data, then connect downstream to Jira so issues can link to epics or tickets you already use. You keep working where you work; Issue_Tracker becomes the triage and intelligence layer that keeps everything coherent.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Totally fair. We handle that in two ways. First, clusters maintain traceability\u2014so you can inspect the underlying tickets and evidence quickly. Second, your team can split or merge clusters, and those decisions are remembered. Over time, you build a defensible history of what you considered \u201cthe same issue\u201d and why, which helps when teams revisit old debates six months later.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: Exactly. Issue_Tracker keeps a searchable record of the theme, impacted customers, status, linked Jira work, and the reasoning behind prioritization changes. So when an exec asks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we fix this last quarter?\u201d you can answer with evidence instead of tribal memory.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: A typical support ops workflow is: the system clusters, then your ops lead reviews the top themes and pushes the top 10 to product/engineering each week. Each theme includes representative ticket examples, volume trends, severity distribution, and a list of impacted customers. Engineering gets fewer, higher-quality inputs; support stops forwarding noisy threads; product gets a prioritized queue grounded in customer and business impact.",

    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: The common pattern is a big reduction in duplicate noise\u2014teams taking thousands of monthly tickets and managing them as a small set of active themes\u2014and faster alignment on priorities because the scoring is shared and explainable. It tends to reduce escalations and rework because product and engineering get clearer signals earlier.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: That\u2019s a perfect fit for the prioritization model\u2014especially if we incorporate customer tier, churn risk flags, and segment weighting. It makes \u201cquiet but high-risk\u201d issues rise. And because the themes stay linked back to the original conversations, your team can quickly show what customers are experiencing without hunting through systems.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Sneha Reddy: For a first step, I\u2019d suggest a 30-minute working session. We\u2019d map your current flow\u2014Zendesk to Jira, how you tag severity, how you define customer tiers\u2014and identify the inputs that should drive your priority score. If you\u2019re open to it, we can also look at a small sample of recent tickets to show how clustering would reduce noise and what the top themes would look like.",

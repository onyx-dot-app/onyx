      "text": "Camila Vega: Hi Zain\u2014Camila Vega here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll keep it brief. I work with teams who are trying to get crisper on who their best customers are and then translate that into messaging that actually converts. Does that sound relevant to what Elmspire Telecom is working on right now?",

    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: Hi Camila\u2014yeah, it does. We\u2019ve been debating ICP a lot lately, and messaging is\u2026 inconsistent, honestly.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to ask about. When you say inconsistent, is it more on the website/landing pages, or more in outbound and sales decks\u2014or both?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-3"
    },
    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: Both. Marketing has one story, sales has another, and then customer success has a third. It\u2019s hard because SMB and mid-market care about different things.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Makes total sense. The quick reason I called is we built a product called Customer_Analyzer that takes the customer signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and turns them into two practical outputs. The one I think you\u2019d care about most is our positioning recommendations for specific segments.",

    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: Okay. What do you mean by \u201cpositioning recommendations\u201d exactly?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Think of it as: you pick two ICP tiers\u2014like SMB vs mid-market\u2014and the system generates segment-specific messaging blocks you can actually use. For each segment it produces a value proposition, top use cases, differentiators, proof points you should collect, plus pricing/value framing notes and an objection-handling playbook. And it\u2019s not a black box\u2014each recommendation links back to the underlying drivers and the evidence it used.",

    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: Interesting. We\u2019ve tried \u201cmessaging frameworks\u201d before, and they\u2019re usually too generic. How does it avoid that?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Two ways. First, it\u2019s grounded in observed customer language\u2014so it pulls themes and phrasing from the signals you ingest, like tickets and notes, not just a template. Second, it\u2019s tied to fit drivers for each segment, meaning it\u2019s explicit about why SMB is a fit for X and mid-market is a fit for Y. So instead of one watered-down narrative, you get two sharp ones\u2014with the \u201cwhy\u201d attached so teams can align.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: That \u201cwhy\u201d part is key. Our teams argue because no one trusts the inputs.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. If you can point to: \u201cHere are the top drivers; here are the supporting quotes/events/tickets; here\u2019s the message we should lead with,\u201d it stops being opinion-based. Let me ask\u2014do you currently run separate landing pages or outbound sequences for SMB vs mid-market?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-11"
    },
    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: We have separate outbound sequences, but landing pages are mostly the same. We\u2019ve talked about splitting them, just haven\u2019t done it.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: That\u2019s a perfect starting use case. A common first win is: create two segment-specific landing page hero blocks and a matching outbound opener for each tier\u2014SMB vs mid-market\u2014so the first touch, the page, and the sales deck all reinforce the same message. Customer_Analyzer outputs editable blocks for that: website hero copy, sales deck bullets, email openers\u2014so you\u2019re not starting from scratch.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally fair. For a pilot, it\u2019s lightweight. Usually we start with data you already have: a CRM export with a few key fields, a handful of onboarding survey responses if you have them, and a sample of support tickets or call notes. The goal isn\u2019t perfection on day one\u2014it\u2019s \u201cgood enough to ship messaging you can test\u201d in a couple weeks, then you iterate as more signals come in.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-15"
    },
    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: And does it help with objections? Mid-market especially\u2014we get pushback on price and on switching costs.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-16"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Yes\u2014that\u2019s part of the positioning recommendations output. For each segment, it generates an objection-handling playbook tied to the fit drivers. So if mid-market is worried about switching costs, it will recommend how to frame proof points you should collect\u2014like time-to-value milestones, migration support stories, or operational risk reduction\u2014and it will suggest how to position pricing in terms of value. It won\u2019t magically invent proof, but it will tell you what proof to gather and how to use it.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: That\u2019s useful. Our sellers often don\u2019t know what proof points to ask for, so we end up with random case studies.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. The \u201cproof points to collect\u201d piece is underrated\u2014it helps marketing and CS know what to capture, and sales knows what to ask for. Quick question: who owns messaging alignment at Elmspire today\u2014product marketing, sales enablement, someone else?",

    {

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Got it. What I\u2019d suggest is a short follow-up with you and whoever leads product marketing\u201430 minutes\u2014where I can show you what the SMB vs mid-market outputs look like in practice: the landing page blocks, the email openers, and the objection playbook, all linked to evidence. If it looks relevant, we can talk about a small pilot scoped specifically to those two tiers.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Perfect. Before we schedule\u2014one more calibration question so the demo is tailored: for SMB vs mid-market, what\u2019s the biggest difference you *think* is true today? Is it the primary use case, the buyer persona, or the value metric?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1460274-23"
    },
    {
      "text": "Zain Mahmood: Buyer persona and value metric. SMB is more hands-on operators looking for simplicity. Mid-market is more about reliability and scaling, and they care about risk.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great\u2014that\u2019s exactly the kind of hypothesis Customer_Analyzer can validate and then translate into messaging. I\u2019ll tailor the walkthrough around: \u201csimplicity and speed\u201d for SMB versus \u201crisk reduction and scalability\u201d for mid-market, and show how the system backs that up with signals and then produces the messaging blocks.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: For the first demo, nothing\u2014just context. If you decide to do a pilot, we\u2019d ask for a basic CRM export and a sample set of recent support tickets or call notes. But for the next step, I\u2019ll just run you through examples and how we\u2019d structure the SMB vs mid-market landing page and outbound messaging.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Perfect. I\u2019ll keep it tight. I\u2019m reaching out because a lot of product and go-to-market teams I talk to are trying to answer the same question you probably face at Ironspruce Robotics: \u201cWhich customer segments should we double down on next quarter, and how do we talk about the product in a way that actually lands?\u201d We built a SaaS product called Customer_Analyzer that helps teams get aligned on their best-fit customers and turns that into usable positioning for sales and marketing.",

    {
      "text": "Nora Wheeler: Okay. We\u2019re definitely thinking about industry focus for next quarter. But we already have a CRM and dashboards. What\u2019s different here?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Great question. Most dashboards tell you what happened. Customer_Analyzer is built to connect your customer signals\u2014things like CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and translate them into two outcomes you can act on: a fit score by segment, and then positioning recommendations for the segments you want to prioritize.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. And not just by revenue. For example, one common use case is prioritizing which industries to target next quarter using retention and support burden signals. So you\u2019re not just chasing the loudest segment\u2014you\u2019re weighting who sticks around, who expands, and who doesn\u2019t drain your team with constant tickets.",

    {
      "text": "Nora Wheeler: That\u2019s interesting. We\u2019ve had some segments that look great in bookings but turn into a support sinkhole.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s the exact pattern we see. The way teams use us is: they pull in renewal/retention data and support volume, tag it by industry or segment, and Customer_Analyzer surfaces \u201cthese are your highest-fit segments based on the drivers that correlate with healthy customers.\u201d Then the second part\u2014where teams usually get stuck\u2014is: \u201cCool, so what do we say to those segments?\u201d That\u2019s where our positioning_recommendation feature comes in.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Totally fair. Ours is intentionally not a strategy deck. positioning_recommendation generates segment-specific messaging blocks that your team can immediately use and edit\u2014like website hero copy, sales deck bullets, and email openers. And it links each recommendation back to the evidence and drivers it used\u2014so you can see, \u201cWe\u2019re emphasizing fast deployment because usage events and onboarding survey language show that\u2019s what best-fit customers care about,\u201d for example.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: Exactly. It combines observed customer language\u2014support tickets, call notes, surveys\u2014with the fit drivers you\u2019re using to prioritize segments. Then it outputs: a value proposition for that segment, top use cases, key differentiators, proof points you should collect, some pricing/value framing notes, and an objection-handling playbook. The goal is consistency\u2014so marketing and sales aren\u2019t improvising different narratives for the same segment.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: That\u2019s a really common pain. And because it\u2019s tied to the segment, you\u2019re not getting generic rebuttals. You\u2019re getting \u201cIn robotics manufacturing accounts, the top objection is X; here\u2019s the response, here are the proof points to gather, and here\u2019s the email line that tends to work.\u201d Then your team can tweak it to match your voice.",

    {
      "text": "Megan Foster: It\u2019s typically lightweight to start. For a first pass, teams often begin with a CRM export plus a support ticket export, then optionally add onboarding survey data or a small set of interview notes. You can get an initial segment ranking and draft positioning pretty quickly, then decide if you want to connect product usage events later for more signal.",

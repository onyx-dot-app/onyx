      "text": "Camila Vega: Hi Nikhil\u2014good to see you again. Last time you mentioned Blueharbor Dynamics is trying to get sharper on which customer segments are actually worth building for, not just selling to. Does that still capture the priority for product planning?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-1"
    },
    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: Yeah, that\u2019s right. We\u2019re getting pulled in a lot of directions. Sales has opinions, Product has opinions, and we don\u2019t have a clean way to decide which segment is truly high-fit versus just loud.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-2"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Perfect. Today I want to keep this tight and focus on one piece of Customer_Analyzer that maps directly to that: the fit estimation. The idea is we ingest the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding surveys, product usage events, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and we turn that into a fit score from 0 to 100 at both the account and segment level. Then we show the driver breakdown so it\u2019s not a mystery.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: The \u201cnot a mystery\u201d part matters. My biggest concern is anything that feels like a black box. If it spits out a score but my team can\u2019t understand it, they won\u2019t use it.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-4"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Totally fair, and honestly it\u2019s the most common concern on call two. What we do to avoid the black box perception is two things. First, you choose\u2014or we start from templates for\u2014your fit drivers. For example: industry and size, problem severity, time-to-value, adoption patterns, support burden, churn risk signals, willingness to pay. Second, every score comes with a driver breakdown: \u201cHere\u2019s why this account is an 82, and here\u2019s why this segment is a 61.\u201d It\u2019s basically a transparent model card for each output.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: Okay. But how do you connect it to outcomes? Like, I don\u2019t want a score that\u2019s just \u201cseems good.\u201d I want to see it tied to retention or expansion, otherwise it\u2019s just another dashboard.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-6"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. The recommended ICP profile is based on observed outcomes you care about\u2014retention, conversion, expansion, support load. So if we find, for instance, that mid-market customers in a certain industry hit value in two weeks, adopt three key features, submit fewer tickets, and expand within 90 days, those drivers get weighted as \u201cwhat good looks like\u201d for your product today. And you can sanity-check it because you can click into the cohort and see examples of the accounts that make up that pattern.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-7"
    },
    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: That would help. For product planning, we\u2019re trying to decide between building deeper workflow for Segment A versus adding integrations that would appeal to Segment B. We\u2019ve got anecdotes, but not proof.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-8"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Great use case. Here\u2019s how teams typically use fit estimation for that exact decision: we compare segments side-by-side\u2014Segment A vs Segment B\u2014and Customer_Analyzer shows (1) the average fit score by segment, (2) the driver deltas, and (3) which unmet needs show up in your qualitative signals like interview notes or support themes. So you can say, \u201cSegment A is higher fit, but Segment B has an unmet need that\u2014if we solve it\u2014could raise fit and expansion.\u201d That\u2019s a roadmap bet grounded in data instead of opinions.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-9"
    },
    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: Makes sense. Another concern: our data is messy. CRM fields aren\u2019t consistently filled out, and usage events are good but not perfect. How sensitive is the model to gaps?",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-10"
    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Also a fair callout. We handle it in a few ways: we can start with the signals that are strongest for you\u2014usually usage events and a few high-quality CRM fields\u2014and then layer in other sources as they\u2019re cleaned up. The fit score includes confidence indicators, so if an account has thin data, you\u2019ll see that. And the driver breakdown will show what it relied on. Practically, most customers start with \u201cgood enough\u201d data for an initial ICP direction, then refine.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-11"

    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: If it shows confidence, that helps. I just don\u2019t want Product making roadmap choices off shaky inputs without knowing it.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Completely agree. Let me anchor this back to Blueharbor: based on what you shared last time, you have solid product usage telemetry and a decent ticketing system history. If we start with adoption patterns, time-to-value signals, and support burden as drivers, you\u2019ll quickly get a view of which segments succeed without needing perfect CRM hygiene on day one.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/1712394-13"
    },
    {
      "text": "Nikhil Verma: Okay, that feels realistic. What would the first 30 days look like if we said yes?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: In the first week, we\u2019d connect your core sources\u2014typically CRM plus product events and support tickets. In week two, we\u2019d workshop fit drivers with you and one stakeholder\u2014still just a short session\u2014to define \u201cgood outcomes\u201d for the model to optimize against. Weeks three and four, you\u2019d get your initial segment comparison and recommended ICP profile, and we\u2019d validate it with a handful of known accounts: \u201cDo these high-fit accounts look like your best customers?\u201d Then you\u2019d use that output to guide the roadmap discussion you mentioned.",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: Exactly. And if it doesn\u2019t match, we don\u2019t hand-wave it\u2014we adjust the drivers or the outcome target. That\u2019s how we keep trust high. Quick question: for product planning, which outcome matters more for you right now\u2014retention, expansion, or reducing support burden?",

    {
      "text": "Camila Vega: We can start smaller. Most teams begin with a single workspace focused on fit estimation for product planning\u2014segment scoring, driver breakdown, and ICP recommendation\u2014then expand to additional teams once it\u2019s proving value. For Blueharbor, I\u2019d propose a pilot sized to your top two segments plus your active customer base, so we can get statistically meaningful comparisons without boiling the ocean.",

      "text": "Camila Vega: Two things: (1) access to the core data sources\u2014read-only is fine\u2014and (2) agreement on the initial drivers and outcomes. Also, I\u2019d ask you to nominate 10 accounts you consider \u201cbest fit\u201d and 10 that churned or stalled. That gives us a fast reality check when we review results.",

Here\u2019s what high-fit customers do differently.

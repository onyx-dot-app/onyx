Update the matching logic to require higher-confidence signals (e.g., verified domain + known CRM account mapping) and fall back to an \u201cunmatched\u201d state rather than auto-linking on ambiguous matches. Add logging/metrics for match decisions and surface a review queue entry for ambiguous cases so impacted-customer counts and revenue exposure aren\u2019t misattributed.",

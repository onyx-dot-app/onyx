I\u2019m calling because we\u2019ve been working with product and marketing teams who are trying to get really crisp on which customer segments are actually \u201cbest fit\u201d versus just loud demand, and I thought it might be relevant for Quartzhaven.",

      "text": "James Choi: Totally. The product is called Customer_Analyzer. It pulls in signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding survey responses, product usage, support tickets, even interview notes\u2014and turns that into two things. First, a fit score by account and by segment, 0 to 100, with a breakdown of what\u2019s driving it up or down. Second, practical positioning recommendations\u2014what to lead with, proof points, and how to handle common objections for each segment.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: For insurers, a common use case is segment prioritization for the next quarter\u2014especially when you\u2019re weighing industries or customer types and trying to balance retention with support cost. Customer_Analyzer looks at outcomes like renewal, expansion, support burden, and adoption patterns, then compares segments\u2014say, \u201cregional brokers\u201d versus \u201cdirect-to-consumer,\u201d or SMB employer groups versus mid-market\u2014so you can see which ones are truly healthiest and where you\u2019re paying for growth with churn or tickets.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Great question. Most teams can see retention rates, but they can\u2019t easily explain *why* a segment is performing that way across disparate signals\u2014or translate it into action for go-to-market. The fit estimation feature lets you define fit drivers\u2014industry, size, problem severity, time-to-value, willingness to pay, adoption/usage, support burden, churn risk\u2014and then it produces a driver breakdown. So instead of \u201cSegment A renews more,\u201d you get \u201cSegment A renews more because time-to-value is faster, adoption is higher by week two, and support burden is lower,\u201d and you can use that to make an ICP recommendation and adjust messaging.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s fair. We don\u2019t require product events\u2014those are optional. Many teams start with CRM + support + onboarding and interviews. Even simple proxies work: time-to-value from onboarding milestones, support burden from ticket volume and categories, and adoption from engagement touchpoints if you have them. The idea is to use what you already track, then normalize it into a fit model and segment comparisons.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Completely agree. The score is only useful if it\u2019s transparent. That\u2019s why we show the driver breakdown\u2014what inputs contributed to the score and by how much\u2014plus comparisons across segments. You can also weight drivers based on what matters to Quartzhaven. If support burden is killing margins, you can prioritize that. If retention is the main goal, weight that more heavily.",

The first outcome is usually: \u201cHere are the top two segments we should target next quarter, and here\u2019s the narrative that\u2019s working for them.\u201d That\u2019s where the positioning recommendations come in\u2014value props, differentiators, proof points, and objection handling aligned to what the data shows those segments respond to.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Understood. I\u2019m not trying to wedge in a big implementation. The reason I reached out is that a quick analysis can help confirm whether your planned segments are the ones that actually renew with low support cost. If you\u2019re already planning, this either validates your direction\u2014or it flags a segment that looks good on pipeline but historically churns or burns support.",

      "text": "James Choi: Absolutely\u2014insurance tends to have tighter controls.

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Minimal, in the best case. Typically we ask for a basic export\u2014accounts, segments, a few outcome fields like renewal status, and any signals you already have around onboarding completion and support volume. Then we come back with a segment-level view: fit scores, driver breakdown, and an initial ICP recommendation. If it looks promising, then we do a deeper pass and talk about positioning.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: That makes sense. Even if you\u2019re not changing ICP, the fit estimation can help with prioritizing within the ICP\u2014like which industries inside your target are actually low support burden and high retention. And the positioning piece can help your team sharpen messaging for the segment you\u2019re executing on\u2014what proof points to emphasize, and which objections to anticipate.",

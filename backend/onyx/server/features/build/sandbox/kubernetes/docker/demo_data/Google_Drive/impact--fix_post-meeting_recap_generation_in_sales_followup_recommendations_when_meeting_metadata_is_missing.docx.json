      "text": "This change improves reliability of post\u2011meeting follow\u2011up recommendations by fixing recap generation when CRM meeting metadata is missing or incomplete. Today, some opportunities silently fail to show recaps and next\u2011step guidance if the meeting record is absent or fields like attendees, transcript/notes link, or outcome are empty, creating inconsistent user experience and lowering trust in the feature.\n\nWe will add defensive handling and sensible fallbacks so recap and next\u2011step templates can still render using best\u2011available data (e.g., opportunity context, prior activity, or partial meeting details). When inputs are partially available, the system should degrade gracefully rather than failing the entire recommendation set.\n\nFor cases where required inputs are truly unavailable, we will introduce structured error logging to capture the exact missing fields and the affected opportunity/meeting identifiers. This will improve observability, speed up support/debugging, and help us quantify how often data quality issues in the CRM impact output.\n\nOn the UI, we will replace silent omission with a clear \u201crecap unavailable\u201d state, so users understand why a recap isn\u2019t shown and can take corrective action (e.g., update the meeting record or add notes). Overall impact: higher recommendation coverage, fewer confusing gaps, and clearer accountability between product behavior and underlying CRM data quality.",

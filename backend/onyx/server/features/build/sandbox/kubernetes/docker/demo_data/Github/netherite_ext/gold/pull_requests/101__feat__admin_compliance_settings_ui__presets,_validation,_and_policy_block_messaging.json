      "text": "## Description\r\n\r\n## Summary\nAdds an in-app admin UI in Sales_Accelerator to view and update tenant-level compliance settings introduced in GOLD-131. Includes one-click presets for common regulated configurations, end-to-end validation, and explicit user-facing messaging that explains why AI generation or comms ingestion is blocked by policy.\n\n## What changed\n- **Admin UI (Sales_Accelerator)**\n  - New compliance settings screen for tenant admins.\n  - Renders all tenant compliance toggles with **clear, human-readable descriptions** of what each toggle blocks/permits.\n  - Supports editing + saving with optimistic UI + failure rollback messaging.\n\n- **Presets**\n  - Adds preset selector with safe defaults:\n    - **Regulated / No AI Generation**: disables AI generation features governed by GOLD-131 flags.\n    - **PII-Restricted Comms Ingestion**: disables comms ingestion pathways governed by GOLD-131 flags.\n  - Preset application updates the local form state and shows a confirmation before persisting.\n\n- **Validation (high priority / safety)**\n  - **Client-side**: blocks invalid combinations (e.g., dependent toggles) and surfaces inline errors before submit.\n  - **Server-side**: API enforces the same rules; invalid updates return structured validation errors that the UI displays.\n\n- **Policy enforcement messaging**\n  - When AI generation or comms ingestion is disabled by compliance policy, impacted entry points now show an explicit **\u201cBlocked by tenant compliance policy\u201d** message with the specific setting(s) responsible.\n  - Adds a consistent error code/reason mapping so the UI can render \u201cwhy blocked\u201d deterministically.\n\n## Implementation notes\n- Introduces a typed settings model (aligned to GOLD-131) and a single update endpoint call used by the admin UI.\n- Centralizes preset definitions in code (name, description, and toggle values) to keep behavior deterministic and testable.\n- Adds unit coverage for preset application + validation rules, and integration coverage for blocked-message rendering based on server responses.\n\n## User impact\n- Tenant admins can configure compliance controls without backend intervention.\n- End users get clear guidance when features are unavailable due to tenant policy, reducing support escalations.\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nlocal\r\n",

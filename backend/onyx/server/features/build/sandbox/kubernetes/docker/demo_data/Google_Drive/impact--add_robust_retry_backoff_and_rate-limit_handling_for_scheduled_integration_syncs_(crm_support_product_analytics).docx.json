      "text": "Scheduled integration syncs (CRM, Support, Product Analytics) currently degrade sharply under transient provider issues like 429 rate limits, 5xx errors, and timeouts. When this happens, jobs either fail outright or cascade into repeated failures, leaving customer data stale until the next scheduled run and creating noisy, hard-to-diagnose operational alerts.\n\nThis feature adds a shared, robust retry/backoff and rate-limit handling policy across all scheduled sync jobs. The system will honor provider guidance (e.g., `Retry-After` headers), apply exponential backoff with jitter to reduce thundering-herd retries, and enforce a per-run retry cap so a single schedule doesn\u2019t turn into an unbounded execution that blocks other work.\n\nProduct impact is higher sync reliability and data freshness with fewer customer-visible gaps caused by temporary upstream instability. Engineering/ops impact is reduced error spam and clearer incident signals: failures become deliberate and controlled rather than repeated, unpredictable cascades, and provider rate limits are respected to prevent escalations.\n\nFinally, the retry policy will ensure runs fail \u201ccleanly\u201d when they must, surfacing a terminal run status that plugs into existing observability. This enables safe recovery on the next scheduled run and avoids partial or inconsistent writes, improving trust in integration health while keeping the system resilient under real-world API conditions.",

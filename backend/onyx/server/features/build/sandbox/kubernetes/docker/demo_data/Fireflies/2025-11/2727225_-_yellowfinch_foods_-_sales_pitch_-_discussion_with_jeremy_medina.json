      "text": "Mina Park: Hi Jeremy\u2014Mina Park here. Thanks for taking a few minutes. I\u2019ll be brief. I work with teams that are drowning in support tickets and struggling to turn that noise into clear, prioritized product issues without a ton of manual work. Does that sound even remotely familiar at Yellowfinch Foods?",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally understood. The product is called Issue_Tracker. It sits between your support tools\u2014like Zendesk or Intercom\u2014and delivery tools like Jira or Linear, and it creates a standardized \u201cissue object\u201d out of raw tickets: deduplicated clusters, evidence, impacted customers, and links back to the source conversations and the engineering work. The quick pitch is: less noise, clearer themes, and better prioritization tied to business impact.",

    {
      "text": "Jeremy Medina: We already use Zendesk and Jira. We also have our own tagging and some dashboards. Not sure we need another layer.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s fair\u2014and we\u2019re not trying to replace Zendesk or Jira. The value is in the connective tissue: we ingest tickets from Zendesk/Intercom/Help Scout, apply dedupe rules so duplicates merge into one cluster, and then sync context from Salesforce or HubSpot\u2014like account value or open opportunities\u2014so the issues are prioritized by revenue exposure or deal risk, not just volume. Then we back-link everything so your team can click from a cluster to the original Zendesk tickets or the Jira epics.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7238708-5"
    },
    {
      "text": "Jeremy Medina: Okay, but we can kind of do that manually. Our support ops manager pulls themes every week and sends a list to product. It\u2019s not perfect, but it works.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That weekly theme pull is exactly the workflow we\u2019re designed for. One of the common use cases is support ops taking something like 5,000 monthly tickets and clustering them into ~80 active themes automatically\u2014then routing the top 10 clusters to product/engineering weekly with representative examples and the list of affected customers. It cuts the time spent arguing about \u201cis this really a theme\u201d and reduces duplicate work.",

    {
      "text": "Jeremy Medina: I get the idea. But I\u2019m cautious. Any new tool means admin, setup, change management. Also, we\u2019re pretty locked into our current processes.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Makes sense. Setup is mostly connectors and field mapping\u2014point at Zendesk, connect Jira, and optionally Salesforce/HubSpot if you want account context. You can define your dedupe rules\u2014like subject similarity, product area, tag combinations\u2014and we keep your existing systems as the source of truth. No one has to re-enter data; we\u2019re just organizing and linking it.",

      "text": "Jeremy Medina: The Salesforce angle is interesting, but we\u2019re not big on piping support data into CRM. Data governance gets messy fast.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Totally\u2014so we don\u2019t push raw ticket content into CRM by default. The integration can be one-way: we pull account and opportunity metadata to score impact. For example, if a cluster affects high-ARR accounts or a deal in negotiation, it bubbles up. The point is to stop the \u201cwe didn\u2019t realize this bug was blocking a renewal\u201d surprise.",
      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/7238708-11"

    {
      "text": "Jeremy Medina: Sure, but we already have internal escalation paths. If something is truly critical, it gets attention.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Right\u2014and Issue_Tracker is most helpful in the gray area: the issues that aren\u2019t a single P0 ticket, but are quietly hitting lots of customers, creating churn risk, or slowing expansion. Clustering makes those patterns obvious. And because every cluster links back to the original tickets, it\u2019s defensible\u2014you\u2019re not relying on someone\u2019s summary in a spreadsheet.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Great question. Usually support ops or product ops owns the workflows\u2014support ops likes it because it reduces ticket noise and repetitive triage. Product teams like it because they get a consistent issue format, evidence, and impacted customer lists instead of a grab bag of anecdotes. But yes, it needs a clear owner.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s fair. If you\u2019re open to it, the next step would be a 30-minute call with whoever runs support ops and maybe someone from product, and we can map your current flow: Zendesk tags \u2192 weekly review \u2192 Jira creation. Then I can show how clustering and back-links would reduce the manual work rather than add to it.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. One way some teams justify it is by reducing the time spent on triage and duplicate ticket handling\u2014plus fewer escalations driven by missed patterns. But if budget is frozen, it may not be the right moment.",

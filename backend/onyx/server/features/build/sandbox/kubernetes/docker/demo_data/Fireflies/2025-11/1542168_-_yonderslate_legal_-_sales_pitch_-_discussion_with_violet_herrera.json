      "text": "James Choi: Totally. The product is called Customer_Analyzer. It connects the signals you already have\u2014CRM fields, onboarding notes, usage, support tickets\u2014and it outputs two things: a customer \u201cfit score\u201d by account and segment, and then positioning recommendations you can use in outbound and on landing pages.",

      "text": "James Choi: That makes sense, and you\u2019re not alone. When I say signals, I\u2019m not assuming app telemetry. For a services org like Yonderslate Legal, it can be things like matter type, practice area, intake source, cycle time, revision rounds, support burden\u2014basically what correlates to profitable, smooth engagements versus the ones that churn or drag.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: Right\u2014and what we see is teams can report profitability, but it\u2019s harder to translate that into a clear ICP and consistent messaging. The feature we lean on is fit estimation: it gives a 0\u2013100 fit score at the account level and then breaks down *why*\u2014industry, size, urgency, time-to-value, support burden, churn risk signals. Then you can compare segments, like \u201cSMB vs mid-market,\u201d and decide which tier you want to prioritize.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Got it. The reason I mention SMB vs mid-market is one common use case: creating segment-specific landing page and outbound messaging for two ICP tiers. Even in a referral-driven model, your website and follow-up emails still do a lot of qualifying and framing\u2014especially when referrals send people who aren\u2019t a good fit.",

It could be as simple as: \u201cHere\u2019s what great-fit clients look like, here\u2019s what we\u2019re best at, here\u2019s proof, and here are common objections handled.\u201d Customer_Analyzer generates positioning recommendations off the segments that actually lead to clean delivery and repeat work.",

    {
      "text": "James Choi: That\u2019s fair. Let me ask one quick question: do you ever have the issue where intake looks good, you onboard, and then it becomes high-maintenance\u2014scope creep, lots of back-and-forth, slow decisions?",

      "link": "https://www.onyx.app/4509620-14"
    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Exactly. What the fit score does is quantify the patterns behind that\u2014so you can spot them early and adjust how you position or qualify. For example, if \u201cdecision speed\u201d and \u201cstakeholder complexity\u201d are the biggest drivers of low-fit outcomes, you can build that into your intake questions and even the language on your practice pages.",

    {
      "text": "Violet Herrera: We\u2019d need IT involved for anything that touches our CRM. And honestly, we\u2019re cautious about tools ingesting client-related info.",

    },
    {
      "text": "James Choi: Completely reasonable. On the data side, we can start with minimal fields\u2014like a handful of CRM attributes and anonymized outcomes\u2014without pulling sensitive matter content. But if involving IT is a hurdle right now, we can also do a lightweight pilot using exports.",

My ask was going to be a short follow-up\u201420 minutes\u2014where I can show what the fit driver breakdown looks like and how it turns into segment messaging, like \u201cSMB vs mid-market\u201d service positioning.

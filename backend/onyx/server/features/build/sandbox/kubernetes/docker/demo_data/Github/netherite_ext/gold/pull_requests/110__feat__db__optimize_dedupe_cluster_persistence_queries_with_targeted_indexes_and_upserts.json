Changes are query/index focused and preserve existing idempotency and merge semantics.\n\n## Key changes\n- **Query rewrites (hot paths)**\n  - Replaced scan-heavy lookups with index-friendly predicates for:\n    - `source_ticket_id`-based issue/object resolution\n    - `conversation_id`-based thread/message association\n    - `normalized_fingerprint`-based dedupe candidate selection\n  - Ensured predicates match the left-most columns of supporting indexes and avoid function-wrapped columns in WHERE clauses (normalization happens before persistence).\n\n- **Write-path improvements**\n  - Converted select-then-insert patterns to **atomic upserts** (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE/NOTHING`) for issue-object and dedupe/cluster linking rows.\n  - Reduced transaction scope around dedupe/cluster updates to minimize lock duration.\n  - Batched persistence where safe to cut round trips without changing ordering/merge outcomes.\n\n- **Indexes added/adjusted**\n  - Added/updated **composite indexes** aligned to common access patterns (e.g., `(source_ticket_id, provider)` / `(conversation_id, provider)` / `(normalized_fingerprint, provider)` as applicable).\n  - Added **unique constraints** where required to support upsert semantics and enforce idempotency.\n  - Removed/avoided redundant single-column indexes when a covering composite index exists.\n\n## Validation\n- Ran ingestion/backfill against a backfill-sized dataset and compared:\n  - Query plans (confirmed index usage, no sequential scans on hot lookups)\n  - Throughput and DB CPU time\n  - Lock wait time during concurrent ingestion\n- Verified behavior invariants:\n  - Re-running the same backlog remains **idempotent**\n  - Dedupe/merge decisions and cluster membership results are unchanged\n\n## Operational notes\n- Includes a DB migration for new/updated indexes/constraints. Apply during a low-traffic window if possible; index creation may be the longest step depending on table size.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

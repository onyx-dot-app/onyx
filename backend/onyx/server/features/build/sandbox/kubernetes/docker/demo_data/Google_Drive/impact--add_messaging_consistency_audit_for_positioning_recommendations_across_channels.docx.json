      "text": "This feature adds an automated \u201cmessaging consistency audit\u201d that continuously checks whether our customer-facing messaging in each channel (website copy, sales deck snippets, and email templates) matches the latest approved positioning recommendations for a given segment. Instead of relying on periodic manual reviews, we\u2019ll have an always-on mechanism that detects drift as assets evolve.\n\nThe backend job will compare each channel\u2019s current messaging assets against the canonical positioning set for the same segment, compute a divergence score based on missing or altered value props, differentiators, and proof points, and persist results over time. By storing scores historically per channel/segment, we can trend consistency, identify chronic problem areas, and correlate improvements to specific positioning updates or content refreshes.\n\nThe primary impact is improved go-to-market alignment: consistent messaging reduces confusion for prospects, increases trust, and makes our narrative more coherent across touchpoints. It also improves internal efficiency by surfacing issues early\u2014reducing ad-hoc \u201cmessaging cleanup\u201d work and enabling Marketing, Sales Enablement, and Product Marketing to prioritize updates where divergence is highest.\n\nOperationally, the job will expose flagged inconsistencies through an internal endpoint and emit log entries, creating the foundation for follow-on UI dashboards and alerting workflows. This establishes a scalable system of record for messaging consistency and enables future automation (e.g., notifications to owners, asset-level drilldowns, and release gates tied to positioning changes).",

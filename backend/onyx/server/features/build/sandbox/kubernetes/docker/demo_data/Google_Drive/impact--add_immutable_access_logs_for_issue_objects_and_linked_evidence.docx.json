      "text": "This feature adds workspace-scoped, immutable access logs for sensitive \u201cissue\u201d objects and any linked evidence, covering both reads and writes. Each log entry will capture who did what and when, plus contextual metadata like source IP address and user agent where available. The intent is to provide a reliable audit trail across issue content, evidence snippets, and key decision/status fields that commonly drive compliance and operational reviews.\n\nFrom a customer impact perspective, this materially improves trust, governance, and compliance readiness (e.g., internal audits, regulated workflows, incident postmortems). Admins will be able to answer questions like \u201cWho viewed this issue?\u201d, \u201cWhen was the decision changed?\u201d, and \u201cWas evidence accessed by an unexpected actor?\u201d with defensible, tamper-resistant records. This reduces risk in environments where access to investigative or sensitive material must be provable.\n\nOn the product surface, we\u2019ll introduce an admin-facing API/UI endpoint for audit review, enabling search and filtering by actor, issue, time range, and action type. This makes the logs actionable (not just stored), supporting routine compliance checks, escalations, and forensic investigations without requiring database access or ad hoc engineering support.\n\nOperationally, logs will be stored in an append-only table and retained according to each workspace\u2019s retention settings, referencing the existing retention framework (GOLD-189) rather than duplicating it. This approach minimizes data policy fragmentation while ensuring audit data is durable, consistent with customer retention expectations, and scalable as access volume grows.",

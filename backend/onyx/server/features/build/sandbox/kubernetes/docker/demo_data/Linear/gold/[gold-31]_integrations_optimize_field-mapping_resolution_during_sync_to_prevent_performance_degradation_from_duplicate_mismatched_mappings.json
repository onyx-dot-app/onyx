      "text": "During integration sync runs, mapping application can become slow when configs contain duplicates or conflicting source\u2192destination pairs, amplifying work and generating redundant signals. Update the sync pipeline to precompute a canonical mapping set per run (dedup + deterministic conflict resolution) and apply mappings in a single pass to avoid N+1 lookups and repeated transforms. Ensure the run emits structured diagnostics (counts of dropped/merged mappings and affected fields) so downstream fit scoring/positioning inputs remain consistent and debuggable.",

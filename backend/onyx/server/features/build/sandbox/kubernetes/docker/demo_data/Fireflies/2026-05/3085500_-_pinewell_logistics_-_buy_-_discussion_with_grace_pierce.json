      "text": "Mina Park: Totally fair. Let\u2019s make it concrete. Last time you mentioned you\u2019re swimming in ticket noise\u2014around 5,000 tickets a month across channels\u2014and you\u2019re trying to get that down to a manageable set of themes for product and engineering. Issue_Tracker\u2019s core value is clustering and dedupe into something like ~80 active themes, and then helping you route the top 10 with evidence and impacted customer lists. Is that still the biggest pain?",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: That\u2019s exactly why I want to focus on two things today: the clustering workflow for reducing noise, and the issue_history feature\u2014because it\u2019s what keeps trust over time. On clustering: we ingest from Zendesk/Intercom, dedupe and cluster, then your team can review the clusters and adjust before they become \u201cofficial\u201d themes. On issue_history: every cluster has a full timeline\u2014creation, merges and splits, priority changes with rationale, linked Jira items, status milestones like investigating \u2192 in progress \u2192 released, plus customer communication history. So when product asks \u201cwhy did we deprioritize this?\u201d it\u2019s not tribal knowledge; it\u2019s documented.",

      "text": "Grace Pierce: The audit trail sounds good. But our biggest concern is still the false merges. If two distinct issues get merged, we look sloppy. If one issue gets fragmented across multiple clusters, we miss the real volume and urgency. We\u2019ve been burned by automation that overpromises.",

    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Yep\u2014if clustering is wrong, everything downstream is wrong. Let me ask: where do you see the language variation most? Different segments describing the same root cause differently? Or different channels like phone vs chat?",

      "text": "Mina Park: Got it. So two points. First, we don\u2019t position this as \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d We position it as \u201c80% automated, 20% human-in-the-loop,\u201d with controls. Your ops lead can review the top clusters weekly, approve merges, split clusters when needed, and add a note on why. Second, issue_history helps reduce rework even when you do have to correct a cluster\u2014because the changes are tracked. If you split a cluster, you don\u2019t lose the story: what got moved, why, which customers were impacted, and which Jira work items were linked.",

    },
    {
      "text": "Mina Park: Fair. The way teams usually do this is they don\u2019t review everything. They review the top 10\u201320 clusters by volume or revenue exposure, because those are the ones that matter. The long tail can stay automated and still be helpful for search and pattern detection. Also, the point is to replace the manual tagging and summary work you\u2019re doing today. Instead of support ops reading hundreds of tickets to write a weekly \u201cthemes\u201d doc, the system generates the clusters and the evidence set automatically.",

      "text": "Mina Park: We\u2019re not trying to replace Jira intake. Issue_Tracker sits between support and Jira. The \u201cissue object\u201d stays linked: cluster with root cause hypothesis + evidence + affected customers on our side, and then one or more Jira tickets on their side. The benefit for product is: when they open a Jira item, it\u2019s not just \u201csupport says this is bad.\u201d It\u2019s \u201chere are the representative examples, here are the customers, here\u2019s the history, here\u2019s what we told them.\u201d That tends to reduce the back-and-forth.",

      "text": "Mina Park: Understood. Implementation-wise, for Pinewell, I\u2019d propose a lightweight start: connect Zendesk, connect Jira, and import your last 90 days of tickets. Then we\u2019d configure your cluster review rules and set up a weekly export of the top 10 themes to your product meeting. That\u2019s it to start. If we can\u2019t show \u201c5,000 tickets \u2192 ~80 themes\u201d with something your team trusts, we stop.",

You give us an export\u201490 days\u2014so we can show you what your themes would look like, and we can quantify how often clusters would need correction.

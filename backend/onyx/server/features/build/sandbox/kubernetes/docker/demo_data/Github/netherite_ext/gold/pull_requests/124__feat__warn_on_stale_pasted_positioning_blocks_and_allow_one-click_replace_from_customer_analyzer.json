If a mismatch is detected, the UI shows a non-blocking warning with a one-click action to replace the pasted content with the latest Customer_Analyzer version.\n\n### Implementation details\n- **Comparison step on paste/edit**\n  - On positioning block paste and on subsequent edits, the client requests the latest Customer_Analyzer block metadata + content for the current `{accountId, opportunityId}`.\n  - Performs a lightweight equivalence check (normalized whitespace + stable section markers) to determine whether the pasted/edited block matches the latest analyzer output.\n  - Treats missing analyzer output or missing IDs as \u201cno comparison available\u201d (no warning).\n\n- **User experience**\n  - When stale is detected, renders an inline warning banner next to the positioning block editor.\n  - Banner includes:\n    - Context text indicating the pasted block differs from the latest Customer_Analyzer output.\n    - CTA: **\u201cReplace with latest from Customer_Analyzer\u201d** which overwrites the editor content with the latest analyzer block.\n  - Warning is non-blocking; user may continue with their pasted content.\n\n- **Event logging / analytics**\n  - Emits an event whenever a stale block is detected and on user resolution action.\n  - Payload includes: `accountId`, `opportunityId`, latest analyzer `version/timestamp`, and `userAction` (`kept` vs `replaced`).\n\n### Notes\n- Designed to be low-risk (medium priority): warning-only behavior, no save blocking, and graceful fallback when analyzer data is unavailable.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nstaging\r\n",

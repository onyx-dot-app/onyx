      "text": "This change fixes a reliability issue in our Jira/Linear link-outs from Issue_Tracker, where users are sometimes taken to broken URLs or the wrong downstream item. The root cause is that issue identifiers and URL formats vary by workspace, and our stored mappings can become stale\u2014so a link that \u201clooks\u201d valid can still be incorrect.\n\nWe\u2019ll update link generation to always use the integration\u2019s configured base URL and workspace slug (rather than assuming a default format), producing correct deep links across different Jira/Linear configurations. In addition, we\u2019ll validate the stored external ID/key before we render the link, so we only present link-outs we\u2019re confident will resolve to the intended issue.\n\nWhen the external ID is missing, invalid, or mismatched, we\u2019ll replace the link with a clear \u201cNot linked\u201d state. From there, users will have an explicit retry/reconnect action to re-establish or refresh the mapping, instead of silently emitting a malformed URL that wastes time and erodes trust.\n\nOverall impact: fewer dead ends, fewer misdirected navigations, and higher confidence that \u201cOpen in Jira/Linear\u201d does what it promises. This also reduces support burden by making integration health issues visible and actionable at the point of use, rather than surfacing as intermittent, hard-to-debug link failures.",

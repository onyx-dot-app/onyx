I\u2019ll keep it brief: I\u2019m calling because we\u2019ve been helping AEs prevent deals from stalling by turning CRM activity into very specific \u201cwhat to do next\u201d guidance, and I thought it could map well to how Keystone Atlas Partners runs pipeline.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: The product is called Sales_Accelerator. It sits on top of Salesforce or HubSpot\u2014so it\u2019s not another CRM\u2014and it focuses on deal execution. The core is: it forecasts outcomes, flags risk early, and, most importantly for reps, it recommends the next best follow-up on each opportunity based on what\u2019s actually happened and who\u2019s involved.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Totally fair. Most dashboards tell you what happened. Sales_Accelerator tells a rep what to do next\u2014inside the CRM\u2014so deals keep moving. For example, one feature we lead with is sales follow-up recommendations: it looks at stage, stakeholder coverage, whether there\u2019s a mutual action plan, and recent activity. Then it suggests the next step and can draft the actual follow-up, like a recap email with next steps and due dates.",

    {
      "text": "Irene Shen: Yeah, generic \u201cAI email writer\u201d usually fails because it\u2019s not connected to the deal context or your approved messaging. The difference here is the recommendation is triggered by real deal signals\u2014like, \u201cmeeting happened, but no follow-up was logged,\u201d or \u201conly one contact engaged for three weeks,\u201d or \u201cmutual plan incomplete for this stage.\u201d And the content it drafts is anchored to your positioning, not random. If you already use something like Customer_Analyzer for fit scores and positioning blocks, Sales_Accelerator consumes that\u2014so reps get tailored proof points and objection responses that are consistent with what you\u2019ve approved.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Not required. Sales_Accelerator still works off your CRM data and activity signals. Customer_Analyzer just strengthens the tailoring layer if you have it\u2014fit scoring, positioning blocks, that kind of thing. But even without it, the immediate value is: fewer stalls, tighter follow-up, and more consistent progression across reps without forcing a rigid methodology.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Yes. After discovery, a super common stall is: everyone leaves the call feeling good, but there\u2019s no written plan, no dates, and no clear stakeholders. In our AE use case, Sales_Accelerator drafts the discovery recap email, inserts two tailored proof points aligned to the account context, and then generates a mutual action plan checklist\u2014things like \u201cSecurity review,\u201d \u201cROI validation,\u201d \u201cStakeholder meeting,\u201d with proposed due dates. It also reminds the rep if those items aren\u2019t moving, so the deal doesn\u2019t silently slip.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: It\u2019s both, but the reason forecasting improves is because we measure concrete progress signals\u2014not just stage. When mutual plans aren\u2019t complete, or activity drops, or stakeholder coverage is thin, those are early warning signals. Managers get a view of at-risk deals with the specific reason and the recommended intervention\u2014so it\u2019s not a vague \u201cred/yellow/green.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cNo follow-up after last meeting\u201d or \u201cSingle-threaded, no exec contact,\u201d and here\u2019s the best next step.",

      "text": "Irene Shen: Completely. Our approach is: don\u2019t add fields, don\u2019t force reps to learn a new methodology. We standardize the high-performing behaviors by making the next action the easiest action. When the tool auto-suggests the recap and next steps right after a meeting, reps save time and look more professional. Adoption usually comes from that immediate payoff, not from compliance.",

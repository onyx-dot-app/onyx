**Ques:** I am getting an error as below, how can I resolve it
```
Error from database() at
SyntaxError: Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position xx
```

**Ans:** This error occurs when **config.json** file JSON structure breaks while modifying values in it. In such scenario, overwrite existing *config.json* file by re-extracting it from utility project zip file.

**Ques:** MySQL gives error *Loading local data is disabled; this must be enabled on both the client and server sides*

**Ans:** MySQL by default disables loading of local files. To enable it run below command
```sql
SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;
```
If running after this query you end up with message as below

*1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER or SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN privilege(s) for this operation*

then only option left is to change **loadmethod** to **insert** as your database administrator does not allow you to enable local_infile due to security concerns.

```
Error from database.executePostgres() at 
error: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "0.0.0.0", user "postgres", database "tallydb", no encryption
```

**Ans:**
You need to set **ssl** to **true** in config.json &gt; database. Also ensure, that your user and database is added in hostssl line in **pg_hba.conf**


**Ques:** I get an error like "Received an invalid column length from the bcp client for colid"

**Ans:** This error is generated by SQL Server bulk load driver. All the textual columns have max length set in **database-structure** file. When any rows has textual data where this length of the text exceeds, this this error is triggered. Generally error will specify column number in front of colid which can be identified by going through the column named in database structure or CSV file. Unfortunately culprit row is not displayed, which one has to manually identify by importing data into Excel via Power Query.

    "content": "Agents are a combination of user specified instructions, knowledge, and [Actions](/overview/core_features/actions).\nThink of them as AI team members that are optimized for a specific task.\nOnyx Agents can be for individual use or shared with other users or\n[user-groups](/admin/user_management/users_and_groups) within Onyx.\n## When to use an Agent\nUse agents to build the best experience for repeat use cases,\nespecially those that can be shared with other members of the team.\nSome common examples include:\n- Onboarding Assistant\n- AI Helpdesk\n- Engineer Copilot\n- Legal Reviewer\nThese are typically scoped down to a particular task such as reviewing documents to ensure they comply with security\npolicies, filling out RFPs based on previously completed ones, etc.\n## Creating an Agent\n### Instructions (Prompting)\n  The Instruction field is infinitely flexible so it is recommended to test different variations and verify the behavior\n  before sharing the Agent broadly with your team.\nProvided below for inspiration is the **Instruction** for the default Onyx experience.\n    ```\n    You are a highly capable, thoughtful, and precise assistant. Your goal is to deeply understand the user's intent, ask clarifying questions when needed, think step-by-step through complex problems, provide clear and accurate answers, and proactively anticipate helpful follow-up information. Always prioritize being truthful, nuanced, insightful, and efficient.\n    The current date is [[CURRENT_DATETIME]]\n    You use different text styles, bolding, emojis (sparingly), block quotes, and other formatting to make your responses more readable and engaging.\n    You use proper Markdown and LaTeX to format your responses for math, scientific, and chemical formulas, symbols, etc.: '$$\\n[expression]\\n$$' for standalone cases and '\\( [expression] \\)' when inline. For code you prefer to use Markdown and specify the language.\n    You can use Markdown horizontal rules (---) to separate sections of your responses.\n    You can use Markdown tables to format your responses for data, lists, and other structured information.\n    ```\n    Note that `[[CURRENT_DATETIME]]` is dynamically replaced and there may be additional Action use instructions\n    depending on the enabled Actions.\nOne of the best parts of creating an Agent is the ability to control the goal/behavior of the Agent.\nThe instructions are purely in natural language and can include things like:\n- Always provide your results in a table.\n- Try to quote directly from the documents rather than rewording anything.\n- Flag information from documents that are older than 3 months.\n### Knowledge\n  It is typically best to include only the necessary knowledge for the Agent to complete its task.\n  The more scoped down the documents, the more reliable the performance.\nWhen creating an Agent, you can include both knowledge from [connectors](/overview/core_features/connectors)\nor file upload. The knowledge from connectors will be kept up to date as documents change in the external sources.\n### Actions\n  If any of the built-in actions (Web Search, Internal Search, Image Generation, Code Interpreter) are missing,\n  contact your Onyx admin.\n  These must be set up in the admin-panel before being made available in the Agent creation flow.\n[Actions](/overview/core_features/actions) (sometimes known as Tools)\nallow the Agents to do things in external applications via APIs.\nSome tools help Onyx give better answers (such as the Onyx built-in tools)\nwhile others allow the system to do more than answer questions.\nSome example common Actions include:\n- Updating ticket statuses based on the conversation and if the user's needs were addressed.\n- Checking the status of a service to give real-time answers.\n- Moving deals along a sales pipeline in a CRM based on call transcripts or user request.\n",

Onyx is intended to provide a fast and snappy experience. If the responses are slow,\n    it may be due to a couple issues.\n    - The LLM attached to the system is slow, has low throughput, or does not support streaming.\n    - You've configured locally running models that are not the default but you do not have a GPU available to the\n      system. Typically this is from setting a local reranking or embedding model.\n## Knowledge and Search\n    If it's an internal document,\n    it may be because the indexing of the application has not completed or because the access controls are incorrectly\n    set. In cases of failure, the system always defaults to least permissive.\n    The most common failure is that the [connector](/admin/connectors/overview) is incorrectly configured.\n    Onyx connectors will fetch updates on a set schedule (typically 30 minutes),\n    this polling frequency can be configured by the admin for each connector. The documents, metadata,\n    and access permissions all receive updates.\n    Web Search must be configured by an admin to be usable.\n    It requires setting up one of the supported Search providers and also a scraper (though this is optional as Onyx\n    provides one built in).\n",

That's why Onyx is fully transparent.\n  You'll have peace of mind knowing exactly how your data is processed and stored,\n  and all of this happening within the Onyx deployment.\n  With GenAI being such a fundamental piece of modern company strategy,\n  we want to offer the most flexible and future proof option.\n  We understand that every team is unique in their needs so we're building Onyx with an emphasis on customizability,\n  both for building on top of the platform and directly modifying it.\n  Open source also gives control over to your team. With the GenAI space rapidly evolving,\n  your vendor of choice may not always be aligned with your team's direction.\n  OSS combines the benefits of building in-house with getting product updates for free.\n  Open source also prevents lock in so that you can leverage any LLM provider (or your own LLM).\n## Commercial Viability\nWe are a team of builders and we want to have as many people find value from our software as possible.\nThis is our singular goal and everything that we do derives from this.\nTo push the boundaries of user experience and AI innovation,\nwe've assembled a core team of world-class developers who share this vision.\nTo borrow from Sid Sijbrandij (Co-Founder, GitLab):\n> \"We need to think in the interests of the project, while tending to the realities of running a business to support it... After all, we know that to sustain the project, we need to make it commercially viable.\"\nWe believe in radical transparencyâ€”both in how we build open software and in the commercial realities of competing in\nthis rapidly evolving space.\n  Every organization, regardless of size or budget, will always have access to Onyx's core capabilitiesâ€”including RAG,\n  deep research, custom agents, and moreâ€”completely free.\nFor organizations with special requirementsâ€”such as usage auditing, granular access controls,\nand white-labelingâ€”we offer the Enterprise Edition, available both as a self-hosted solution and through Onyx Cloud.\nThe Enterprise Edition sustains our mission,\nenabling us to keep the vast majority of Onyx's features free and open for everyone.\n## On Contributions\nOnyx is a project built in collaboration with our community and we openly welcome contributions.\nIt is a point of emphasis of our team to ensure that the Onyx project continues to be easy for teams to contribute to or\nmaintain in house. This comes down to:\n- Intentional high level architecture.\n- Strong product direction and refusal to accept bloat for niche use cases.\n- A consistent and high quality of engineering best practices across the code base.\nTo that end,\nwe ask that contributors work on smaller issues to start and get approval from the maintainers for larger feature\ncontributions.\n",

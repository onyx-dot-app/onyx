    "[OpenAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification)\n"
    "and [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).\n"
    "The built-in Actions include:\n"
    "## Custom Actions\n"
    "Onyx offers flexible options for configuring both custom Actions and their associated authentication.\n"
    "Admins can choose to:\n"
    "- Use a single shared authentication, giving all users the same level of access to Actions.\n"
    "- Require each user to complete their own authentication flow, so Actions respect individual user permissions.\n"
    "Onyx supports both token-based authentication and OAuth.\n"
    "## Actions Button\n"
    "In the Chat input bar, Actions are grouped by the MCP server or OpenAPI schema they are registered with.\n"
    "Users have the flexibility to turn on/off the Actions that the Agent/LLM has access to on the fly.\n"

core_features_agents = (
    "Agents are a combination of user specified instructions, knowledge, and [Actions](/overview/core_features/actions).\n"
    "Think of them as AI team members that are optimized for a specific task.\n"
    "Onyx Agents can be for individual use or shared with other users or\n"
    "[user-groups](/admin/user_management/users_and_groups) within Onyx.\n"
    "## When to use an Agent\n"
    "Use agents to build the best experience for repeat use cases,\n"
    "especially those that can be shared with other members of the team.\n"
    "Some common examples include:\n"
    "- Onboarding Assistant\n"
    "- AI Helpdesk\n"
    "- Engineer Copilot\n"
    "- Legal Reviewer\n"
    "These are typically scoped down to a particular task such as reviewing documents to ensure they comply with security\n"
    "policies, filling out RFPs based on previously completed ones, etc.\n"
    "## Creating an Agent\n"
    "### Instructions (Prompting)\n"
    "  The Instruction field is infinitely flexible so it is recommended to test different variations and verify the behavior\n"
    "  before sharing the Agent broadly with your team.\n"
    "Provided below for inspiration is the **Instruction** for the default Onyx experience.\n"
    "    ```\n"
    "    You are a highly capable, thoughtful, and precise assistant. Your goal is to deeply understand the user's intent,"
    " ask clarifying questions when needed, think step-by-step through complex problems, provide clear and accurate answers,"
    " and proactively anticipate helpful follow-up information. Always prioritize being truthful, nuanced, insightful, and efficient.\n"  # noqa: E501
    "    The current date is [[CURRENT_DATETIME]]\n"
    "    You use different text styles, bolding, emojis (sparingly), block quotes, and other formatting to make your responses more readable and engaging.\n"  # noqa: E501
    "    You use proper Markdown and LaTeX to format your responses for math, scientific, and chemical formulas, symbols, etc.:"
    " '$$\\n[expression]\\n$$' for standalone cases and '\\( [expression] \\)' when inline. For code you prefer to use Markdown and specify the language.\n"  # noqa: E501
    "    You can use Markdown horizontal rules (---) to separate sections of your responses.\n"
    "    You can use Markdown tables to format your responses for data, lists, and other structured information.\n"
    "    ```\n"
    "    Note that `[[CURRENT_DATETIME]]` is dynamically replaced and there may be additional Action use instructions\n"
    "    depending on the enabled Actions.\n"
    "One of the best parts of creating an Agent is the ability to control the goal/behavior of the Agent.\n"
    "The instructions are purely in natural language and can include things like:\n"
    "- Always provide your results in a table.\n"
    "- Try to quote directly from the documents rather than rewording anything.\n"
    "- Flag information from documents that are older than 3 months.\n"
    "### Knowledge\n"
    "  It is typically best to include only the necessary knowledge for the Agent to complete its task.\n"
    "  The more scoped down the documents, the more reliable the performance.\n"
    "When creating an Agent, you can include both knowledge from [connectors](/overview/core_features/connectors)\n"
    "or file upload. The knowledge from connectors will be kept up to date as documents change in the external sources.\n"
    "### Actions\n"
    "  If any of the built-in actions (Web Search, Internal Search, Image Generation, Code Interpreter) are missing,\n"
    "  contact your Onyx admin.\n"
    "  These must be set up in the admin-panel before being made available in the Agent creation flow.\n"
    "[Actions](/overview/core_features/actions) (sometimes known as Tools)\n"
    "allow the Agents to do things in external applications via APIs.\n"
    "Some tools help Onyx give better answers (such as the Onyx built-in tools)\n"
    "while others allow the system to do more than answer questions.\n"
    "Some example common Actions include:\n"
    "- Updating ticket statuses based on the conversation and if the user's needs were addressed.\n"
    "- Checking the status of a service to give real-time answers.\n"
    "- Moving deals along a sales pipeline in a CRM based on call transcripts or user request.\n"

    "The page below contains an overview of the main components and features.\n"
    "## Input Bar\n"
    "### Chat with Files / URLs\n"
    "The leftmost button of the input bar lets users add context into the Chat session.\n"
    "Users can choose between uploading files or selecting URLs as well as reusing previous files or URLs.\n"
    "  URLs behind Logins, Captcha, or Paywalls that are not scrapeable are not accessible.\n"
    "  Consider using a [Connector](/overview/core_features/connectors) instead.\n"
    "### Actions Selector\n"
    "The second button lets users disable or force the use of Actions. There are 4 built-in Actions:\n"
    "- **[Internal Search](/overview/core_features/internal_search)**:\n"
    "  Enables the LLM to search the indexed knowledge from [Connectors](/overview/core_features/connectors).\n"
    "- **[Web Search](/overview/core_features/web_search)**: Enables the LLM to search the internet.\n"
    "  Requires an admin to set up an API key for a search provider.\n"
    "- **[Code Interpreter](/overview/core_features/code_interpreter)**:\n"
    "  Enables the LLM to use a sandboxed Python runtime to execute code and run data analysis.\n"
    "- **[Image Generation](/overview/core_features/image_generation)**: Allows the LLM to generate images.\n"
    "  Requires setting up an image generation API.\n"
    "The Actions below the separator represent custom admin configured Actions.\n"
    "See [Actions & MCP](/overview/core_features/actions) to learn about custom Actions.\n"
    "### Deep Research\n"
    "Toggle **Deep Research** using the hourglass icon. When turned on, the LLM will be able to run many cycles of thinking,\n"
    "research, and actions to give the best possible result for the user.\n"
    "This mode is intended for complicated questions that may need to pull together many sources together or requires\n"
    "significant reasoning.\n"
    "  Deep Research may take up to several minutes and could cost many times (>10x) the token cost of a normal inference.\n"
    "### Model Selector\n"
    "Onyx supports all major LLM providers as well as self-hosting options like Ollama, VLLM, etc. For select models,\n"
    "users can also configure the creativity and reasoning level.\n"
    "## Sidebar Contents\n"

    "These can come from either `Internal Search` or `Web Search` or both.\n"
    "Documents in the right sidebar can also be selected to be included in full for the next message in the Chat session.\n"
    "  It's often useful to ask a question to find a document, then select it to do a deep dive on it.\n"
    "## Projects\n"
    "**Projects** are a collection of instructions (prompts) and files as well as a grouping for chats.\n"
    "Use projects to organize ongoing work,\n"
    "or as a handy way to reuse instructions and files without going through the Agent creation flow.\n"
    "## Miscellaneous Chat Features\n"
    "**Chat Sharing** - share chats with other team members by using the share-chat button in the top right (left of the\n"
    "Sources sidebar).\n"
    "**Feedback** - give feedback viewable to the admins using the thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons when hovering an LLM\n"

    "- Performing larger calculations accurately\n"
    "- Running data analysis on provided files\n"
    "- Generating or modifying data/files\n"
    "**Note**: The code interpreter is built-in functionality available to all deployments without any configuration needed.\n"
    "## Features\n"
    "- **Python Runtime**: A secure Python runtime with all dangerous functionality removed (such as accessing the network,\n"
    "  directories outside of the specified, etc.)\n"
    "- **Libraries**: Comes with a set of libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and more.\n"
    "- **File Input**: Ability to pass arbitrary file types along with the code to run against it.\n"
    "- **File Output**: Files can be created and provided back to the user.\n"
    "- **STDIN/STDOUT Capture**: Ability to show the user any outputs of the programs executed.\n"
    "- **Graph Rendering**: The Onyx [Chat UI](/overview/core_features/chat)\n"
    "  is able to render returned graphs and other visualization for the user.\n"
    "## Usage\n"
    "The Code Interpreter does not need to be invoked explicitly,\n"
    "the LLM will determine when to use it depending on the user query.\n"
    "It can also be attached to custom Agents, giving the LLM the option to use it as needed.\n"

    "  processing entirely locally.\n"
    "  Click this card to see more about security.\n"
    "  In the same way LLMs are pre-trained on massive amounts of internet data,\n"
    "  Onyx builds an understanding of all of the documents, concepts, and people within your organization.\n"

    "## Overview\n"
    "The image generation feature allows users to create PNG images according to their prompts which can be rendered in the\n"
    "chat and easily downloaded.\n"
    "## Configuration\n"
    "Currently, Onyx supports two APIs for image generation, both through OpenAI. In the future,\n"
    "there likely will be support for other options such as Google Imagen or Stability AI.\n"
    "**GPT-Image-1**: Newer model, better prompt adherence. Likely a better default for most use cases.\n"
    "**DALL-E 3**: Older model, slightly better for more imaginative and rich styles.\n"
    "## Usage\n"
    "To use **Image Generation**,\n"
    "be explicit in the prompting since the system is tuned to not generate images unless directly instructed.\n"
    "See below for the instructions provided to the system for when to create images.\n"

    "The Search UI also provides more advanced filtering options:\n"
    "The top bar allows users to filter by time ranges (date range / time offset), authors, and tags (e.g. `Folder:\n"
    "Engineering`).\n"

    "    knowledge from [connected applications](/overview/core_features/internal_search),\n"
    "    or things searchable on the web (if [Web Search](/overview/core_features/web_search) is configured)\n"
    "    Please check the [Security](/security/architecture/system_description) tab to learn more.\n"
    "    Onyx is built with security and data privacy as a core commitment.\n"
    "    Onyx is built for teams of all sizes whether it's a single user looking for a local Chat UI or a global enterprise\n"
    "    needing a unified GenAI solution for the entire workforce.\n"
    "    Onyx emphasizes data privacy and security as well as reliable responses by connecting to knowledge whether private\n"
    "    or from the web.\n"
    "   Yes, however Onyx needs an LLM to function properly.\n"
    "   You can air gap the entire system but you would need to run a local LLM.\n"
    "   Note that we strongly recommend using a recent and non-quantized LLM for the best experience.\n"
    "## Technical Issues\n"
    "    The most common culprit is under-resourcing the deployment.\n"
    "    Please refer to the [Resourcing](/deployment/getting_started/resourcing) page to double check.\n"
    "    No! Onyx is intended to provide a fast and snappy experience. If the responses are slow,\n"
    "    it may be due to a couple issues.\n"
    "    - The LLM attached to the system is slow, has low throughput, or does not support streaming.\n"
    "    - You've configured locally running models that are not the default but you do not have a GPU available to the\n"
    "      system. Typically this is from setting a local reranking or embedding model.\n"
    "## Knowledge and Search\n"
    "    If it's an internal document,\n"
    "    it may be because the indexing of the application has not completed or because the access controls are incorrectly\n"
    "    set. In cases of failure, the system always defaults to least permissive.\n"
    "    The most common failure is that the [connector](/admin/connectors/overview) is incorrectly configured.\n"
    "    Onyx connectors will fetch updates on a set schedule (typically 30 minutes),\n"
    "    this polling frequency can be configured by the admin for each connector. The documents, metadata,\n"
    "    and access permissions all receive updates.\n"
    "    Web Search must be configured by an admin to be usable.\n"
    "    It requires setting up one of the supported Search providers and also a scraper (though this is optional as Onyx\n"
    "    provides one built in).\n"

    "## Our Mission\n"
    "Our mission is to make Generative AI and knowledge accessible to every team worldwide.\n"
    "As large language modelsâ€”both proprietary and open-sourceâ€”become increasingly widespread,\n"
    "Onyx serves as the interface to their knowledge and reasoning capabilities.\n"
    "Onyx enriches the utility of the LLM by providing additional context (both web and team internal),\n"
    "built-in tools like code interpreter, and user created Actions.\n"
    "## Why Open Source?\n"
    "  We believe teams should feel safe with the AI platform that they adopt. That's why Onyx is fully transparent.\n"
    "  You'll have peace of mind knowing exactly how your data is processed and stored,\n"
    "  and all of this happening within the Onyx deployment.\n"
    "  With GenAI being such a fundamental piece of modern company strategy,\n"
    "  we want to offer the most flexible and future proof option.\n"
    "  We understand that every team is unique in their needs so we're building Onyx with an emphasis on customizability,\n"
    "  both for building on top of the platform and directly modifying it.\n"
    "  Open source also gives control over to your team. With the GenAI space rapidly evolving,\n"
    "  your vendor of choice may not always be aligned with your team's direction.\n"
    "  OSS combines the benefits of building in-house with getting product updates for free.\n"
    "  Open source also prevents lock in so that you can leverage any LLM provider (or your own LLM).\n"
    "## Commercial Viability\n"
    "We are a team of builders and we want to have as many people find value from our software as possible.\n"
    "This is our singular goal and everything that we do derives from this.\n"
    "To push the boundaries of user experience and AI innovation,\n"
    "we've assembled a core team of world-class developers who share this vision.\n"
    "To borrow from Sid Sijbrandij (Co-Founder, GitLab):\n"
    '> "We need to think in the interests of the project, while tending to the realities of running a business to support it...'
    'After all, we know that to sustain the project, we need to make it commercially viable."\n'
    "We believe in radical transparencyâ€”both in how we build open software and in the commercial realities of competing in\n"
    "this rapidly evolving space.\n"
    "  Every organization, regardless of size or budget, will always have access to Onyx's core capabilitiesâ€”including RAG,\n"
    "  deep research, custom agents, and moreâ€”completely free.\n"
    "For organizations with special requirementsâ€”such as usage auditing, granular access controls,\n"
    "and white-labelingâ€”we offer the Enterprise Edition, available both as a self-hosted solution and through Onyx Cloud.\n"
    "The Enterprise Edition sustains our mission,\n"
    "enabling us to keep the vast majority of Onyx's features free and open for everyone.\n"
    "## On Contributions\n"
    "Onyx is a project built in collaboration with our community and we openly welcome contributions.\n"
    "It is a point of emphasis of our team to ensure that the Onyx project continues to be easy for teams to contribute to or\n"
    "maintain in house. This comes down to:\n"
    "- Intentional high level architecture.\n"
    "- Strong product direction and refusal to accept bloat for niche use cases.\n"
    "- A consistent and high quality of engineering best practices across the code base.\n"
    "To that end,\n"
    "we ask that contributors work on smaller issues to start and get approval from the maintainers for larger feature\n"
    "contributions.\n"

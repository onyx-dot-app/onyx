# Atoms

Base-level building blocks of the Opal design system. Atoms are the smallest, most fundamental UI primitives — they carry no business logic and express only structural or stylistic concerns (layout, spacing, color variants, interaction states).

Higher-level components (such as `Button`, `Card`, `Popover`, etc.) are composed from these atoms rather than duplicating their behavior.

## Contents

| Atom | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Interactive` | Compound component (`Base`, `Container`, `ChevronContainer`) that provides hover/active/pressed states and structural containers for any clickable surface. |

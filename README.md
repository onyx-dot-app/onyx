## 🚀 Deployment Modes

> Onyx supports deployments in Docker, Kubernetes, Helm/Terraform and provides guides for major cloud providers.
> Detailed deployment guides found [here](https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/overview).

Onyx supports two separate deployment options: standard and lite.

#### Onyx Lite

The Lite mode can be thought of as a lightweight Chat UI. It requires less resources (under 1GB memory) and runs a less complex stack.
It is great for users who want to test out Onyx quickly or for teams who are only interested in the Chat UI and Agents functionalities.

#### Standard Onyx

The complete feature set of Onyx which is recommended for serious users and larger teams. Additional features from Lite mode:
- Vector + Keyword index for RAG.
- Background containers to run job queues and workers for sync-ing knowledge from connectors.
- AI model inference servers to run deep learning models used during indexing and inference.
- Performance optimizations for large scale use via in memory cache (Redis) and blob store (MinIO).
